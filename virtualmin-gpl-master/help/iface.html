<header>Network Interface</header>

If you want to set up an IP-based virtual host, this option must be set to <b>Virtual interface with IP</b> and an un-used address entered. Virtualmin will activate this IP on your system when the server is created, and associate it with the server. <p>

If the <b>Shared</b> option is selected, the system's primary network interface address will be used for this server's website and DNS domain instead. <p>
