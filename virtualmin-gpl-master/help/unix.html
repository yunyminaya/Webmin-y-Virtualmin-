<header>Create server administrator</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, a Unix user will be created with the
same name as the virtual server administrator. Depending on the system
configuration, this can be used for SSH and FTP logins, and the user will own
all of the virtual server's files. Except when creating a server
for DNS hosting only, this should be set to <b>Yes</b>. <p>
