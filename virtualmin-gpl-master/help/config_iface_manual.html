<header>Bring up virtual interfaces</header>

By default (when <b>Yes</b> is chosen), Virtualmin will automatically activate
private network interfaces for servers that need them. If this option is set to
<b>No</b>, it will instead assume that you wish to configure these interfaces
manually, perhaps using Xen or Zones configuration files instead of whatever
is standard for your operating system. <p>
