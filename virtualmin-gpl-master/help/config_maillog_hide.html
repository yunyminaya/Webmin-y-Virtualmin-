<header>Allow searching of mail logs</header>

By default, both the master admin and domain owners are able to search and
view mail logs for their domains via the <b>Search Mail Logs</b> page in
Virtualmin. However, this option can be used to prevent access to page if
its CPU load or privacy implications concern you. <p>
