<header>Convert Sub-Domain</header>

This page can be used to convert a sub-domain into a sub-server, by moving
its web pages to under the virtual server's home directory, and extracting DNS
records into a separate domain. Sub-domains are a legacy feature that should
not be used in future, and have fewer features available than full sub-servers.
