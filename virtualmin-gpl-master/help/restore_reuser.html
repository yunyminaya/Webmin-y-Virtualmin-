<header>Re-allocate user and group names</header>

By default, Virtualmin will not allow you to restore a domain if the
administration login is already in use on this system, such as by another
domain with a similar name. However, changing this option to <b>Yes</b>
will force re-allocation of user and group names which will prevent a clash.
This can be useful if you are using <tt>example.com</tt> and want to restore
a backup of <tt>example.org</tt> from a different system. <p>
