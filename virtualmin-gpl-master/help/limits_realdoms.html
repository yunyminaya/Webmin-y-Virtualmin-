<header>Maximum allowed sub-servers</header>

This field sets a limit on the number of sub-servers that this server owner may create.
This can be set lower than the <em>Maximum allowed sub-servers and aliases</em> option
to allow the user to create lots of alias servers, but restrict the number of sub-servers,
which consume more disk space and system resources.<p>
