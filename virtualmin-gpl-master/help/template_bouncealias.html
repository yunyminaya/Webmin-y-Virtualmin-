<header>Bounce email to invalid addresses</header>

When this option is enabled, any email to an address within a domain created
using this template that does not match a user or alias will be bounced back
to the sender. This prevents email to <tt>root@somedomain</tt> from being
delivered to the root user on your server. <p>
