<header>Can create multiple servers from batch file?</header>

Virtualmin's Batch Create Servers page lets users with permissions to add
servers create several at once from a text file. Since this could result
in the fast creation of a large number of domains, you may want to prevent
server administrators from using this feature. To do so, change this setting
to <b>No</b> - this will restrict it to use by the master administrator and
resellers only. <p>
