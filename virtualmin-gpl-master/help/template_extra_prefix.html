<header>Prefix for extra administrators</header>

This field can be used to force extra administration accounts
to have usernames starting with some prefix. This is 
useful to identify which server a particular Webmin user is associated with.
A common value for this field is ${USER}_, which forces extra admins to start
with the same name as the virtual server's primary admin login. <p>
