<header>Record most recent user logins?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, it enables the collection of the most
recent user logins for all domains in the background.
<p>
This information is then displayed on the <b>List Virtual Servers</b> page under
the column named "Last login time" if enabled in the <b>Columns to show</b>
option.
<p>
Since collecting this information can be resource-intensive, you may want to
select <b>No</b> on a system with many domains and users.
