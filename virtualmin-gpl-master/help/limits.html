<header>Server Owner Limits</header>

This page allows the master administrator or a reseller to restrict what the
owner of a virtual server can do using Virtualmin. You can limit the number of
domains, mailboxes, aliases, and other objects they can create, and control
which features of a virtual server they can manage. <p>

These restrictions and limits apply to all sub-servers under the selected
parent server. Limits on the number of mailboxes, aliases and databases
include all servers, rather than being applied on a per-server basis. These
limits do not apply to the master administrator or resellers, only to server
owners and their extra administrator accounts. <p>

If a server is owned by a reseller who has limits on domains, mailboxes or
aliases, they will apply as well as the limits set on this page. The lower
of each limit is the one that will take effect. <p>
