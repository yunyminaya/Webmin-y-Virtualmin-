<header>SSL website setup enabled?</header>
If enabled, an SSL website will be created for every new domain.  If set to "Yes, but not by default" it will be possible to choose to create an SSL website upon domain creation.  Note that SSL websites require an IP all to themselves, so it is not enabled for all sites by default.  Many websites will not need SSL security, and so they can share a single IP with hundreds or thousands of other websites.
