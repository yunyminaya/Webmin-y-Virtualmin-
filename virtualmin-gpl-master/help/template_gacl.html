<header>User and directory chooser settings</header>
 Webmin provides a standard user and directory chooser popup, which can be configured to provide access to some or all users or directories.  Defaults are generally relatively restrictive and only allow access to users within the domain owned by the domain owner account, and directories and files owned by the domain owner group.  If you wish to explicitly configure these options, select "Settings below.."  Be careful with these options, as it is very easy to grant privileges that should not be given to an untrusted user.  Variable substitution occurs for the following related options, so it is possible to specify the ${USER} to select the user that owns the domain or ${HOME} to select the home directory of the domain owner, for example.
