<header>Default database name</header>

Virtualmin allows very flexible database creation and permissions.  This field allows you to specify the default name of databases created as part of domains created from this template.  By default Virtualmin uses the ${PREFIX} variable, which is the first part of the domain name, and will generally also be the domain owner login name for Webmin.  It may be useful to change this, in some circumstances to include a prefix that indicates the template from which it was generated, or to include additional information about the database.  It is possible to combine variables and any characters that are allowed in a PostgreSQL and/or MySQL database (depending on which databases are available).<p>
