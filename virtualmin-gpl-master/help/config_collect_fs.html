<header>Filesystems to include in local disk space</header>

By default the System Information page will display disk space on all local
filesystems. However, this option allows you to enter a space-separate list of
mount points to only check instead. This can be useful if for example you
only care about usage on /home. <p>

After changing this setting you will need to click <b>Refresh system
information</b> on the <b>System Information</b> page. <p>
