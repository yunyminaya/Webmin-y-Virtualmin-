<header>Backup format</header>

This option controls the file format that Virtualmin will use for this backup.
The available options are :
<dl>
<dt>Single archive file
<dd>All virtual servers are storing in a single file, in the location specified
    by the <b>Backup destination</b>.
<dt>One file per server
<dd>Each virtual server is backed up into its own separate file, in the
    directory specified by the <b>Backup destination</b>.
<dt>One file per server, in new format
<dd>Each virtual server is backed up into its own separate file, but in a
    different format to the previous option. This new format is superior as it
    does not require a large file to be created in the <tt>/tmp</tt> directory
    first, this saving disk space.
</dl>

The final option is recommended, as it allowed individual virtual servers to
be more easily restored, and saves on temporary disk space during the backup.
