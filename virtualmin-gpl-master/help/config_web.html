<header>Apache setup and configuration enabled?</header>
This option enables or disables the creation of Apache VirtualNameHost entries and sets up all of the other virtual host features in your Apache configuration file.  If you are using an alternative web server, you may disable this option.  It may be possible to use the plugin module interface to create support for your preferred server (though no other web servers are supported at this time), or you may choose to call an outside script along with variables drawn from the information provided to Virtualmin at domain creation time to setup your preferred webserver.
