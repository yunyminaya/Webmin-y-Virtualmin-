<header>Convert Alias Server</header>

This page can be used to convert an alias virtual server into a sub-server.
It will no longer serve the web pages of the old target server, but can instead
have its own web content. Any existing mail aliases will be preserved, except
for the catchall that forwards mail to the old target server. DNS records will
not be effected. <p>
