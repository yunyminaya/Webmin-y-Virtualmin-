<header>Disk Usage</header>

This page displays disk usage for a virtual server, broken down into
five tabbed sections :

<dl>

<dt><b>Overview</b>
<dd>This section shows the disk quota allocated to the virtual server, the space currently used by files owned by the server, and the size of owned databases.<p>

<dt><b>Home directory</b>
<dd>Shows the space used by the top 10 directories under the server's home. For each, the <b>Quota Size</b> is the size of files owned by the server's Unix grouo, while the <b>Size</b> includes files owned by other users. The latter may be larger for directories like <tt>logs</tt> when have files owned by <tt>root</tt>. The <tt>homes</tt> directory which contains mail / FTP users is not included, as it is accounted for in the next section. <p>

<dt><b>By user</b>

<dt><b>By sub-server</b>
<dd>Shows the disk space used by each sub-server, based on the files in their home directories. The space used by any mailbox users in those servers is also included.<p>
