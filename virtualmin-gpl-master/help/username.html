<header>Email address</header>

This field is for setting the username of the user's email address,
which must be unique within the domain. The user's login name for IMAP/POP3 and
FTP will be based on whatever is entered in this field plus domain name.
For example, if the username is <tt>user1</tt> and the domain <tt>example.com</tt>,
the login would be <tt>user1@example.com</tt>. <p>
