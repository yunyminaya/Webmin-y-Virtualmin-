<header>Compress MySQL backups?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, MySQL database dumps will be gzip
compressed before Virtualmin creates the final backup file, which may also 
itself by compressed again. This saves space when the final backup is only a
TAR file, but does increase the overall backup time. <p>
