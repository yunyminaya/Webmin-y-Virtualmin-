<header>Group for Mailbox Users</header>

Every domain must have an associated Unix group that will be used as the
primary group for any mailbox Unix users. By default a name will be chosen
automatically from the first part of the domain name, but you can use this
field to specify any group name that you like, as long as it does not
already exist. <p>
