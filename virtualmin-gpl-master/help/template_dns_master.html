<header>Master DNS server hostname</header>

By default, Virtualmin will use the system's hostname in the primary NS
and SOA records for new DNS domains it creates. However, if the hostname is not
a valid DNS name or it not suitable for your purposes, this option can
be used to enter a different primary nameserver. It <b>must</b> resolve
to the externally accessible IP address of your system, or the address of
a slave nameserver system for domains created using this template. <p>
