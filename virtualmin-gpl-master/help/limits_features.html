<header>Allowed features for servers</header>

These checkboxes control which features can be selected when creating a 
new virtual server, and which can be enabled or disabled when editing a server.
This can be useful if you want to prevent server owners from using certain
resource-intensive features such as databases, SSL or private IP addresses.<p>
