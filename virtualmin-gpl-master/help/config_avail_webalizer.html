<header>Webalizer Logfile Analysis (for website's logs)</header>
If enabled, Webalizer reporting configuration will be accessible to the domain owner.  This is not the same as enabling report generation, instead this allows the domain owner to configure the Webalizer configuration for their log reports.  For example, they may choose to exclude some segment of their site, or some user-agent, from reports.
