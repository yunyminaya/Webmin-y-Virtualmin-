<header>Show other plugins in users list?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, a list of other plugins
each user has access to will be displayed in a separate column
on the <b>Edit Users</b> page. This enables administrators to
quickly assess the range of plugin access granted to each user.
Selecting <b>No</b> will hide this plugin information column.<p>
