<header>Spam and Virus Scanning</header>

This page allows you to configure settings for spam and virus scanning
that apply to all domains on the system. Each option in the <b>Global spam and virus scanner options</b> form has it's own help page, which you can open by
clicking on their labels. <p>

At the bottom of the page are buttons to configure and start or stop the 
ClamAV and SpamAssassin server scanners. These reduce the time needed to
process each incoming message, but at the cost of higher RAM used from the
continually running servers. <p>
