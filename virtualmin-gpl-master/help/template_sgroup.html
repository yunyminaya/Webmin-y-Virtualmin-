<header>Add domain owners to secondary group</header>

When this field is set to the name of an existing group, all server owner
Unix users will be added to it as secondary members. This can be useful
for configuring other programs like Samba or ProFTPd to further restrict
or allow server owners. <p>

Be sure to select a group that already exists and has no current members,
as its member list will be over-written with the list of Virtualmin domain
owners. <p>
