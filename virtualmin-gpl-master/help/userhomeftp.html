<header>Home directory</header>

By default, the home directory for a website FTP user is the same as the
domain’s base web directory. However, you can change it to the domain’s home
directory (by using an empty value) or to a subdirectory (by using a relative
path under the web directory). <p>
This assumes the FTP server is configured to restrict clients to their home
directories, which should be the default in standard Virtualmin installations.
