<header>Custom Fields</header>

Custom fields allow the administrator to include additional data about domain accounts.  The fields will be displayed when editing the domain.  They can be used for just about any type of data.  For example, it may be useful to have additional contact information attached to the domain account, or a notes field used to explain why a domain is disabled or has some additional feature or limit beyond other domains created with the same template.  If you are developing tools to interact with Virtualmin, these fields may be useful for other purposes.<p>

For each field you must enter the following :

<dl>
<dt><b>Field name</b>
<dd>A short code for this field, which is used to refer to the field in
    templates and post-creation scripts. Each field must have a unique field
    name.<p>

<dt><b>Label</b>
<dd>The text that will be displayed to the user when entering the value for
    this field. If the label contains a ; , anything after it will be used
    as a tooltip that appears when mousing over the field on the Edit Virtual
    Server page.<p>

<dt><b>Type</b>
<dd>This determines what kinds of values can be entered for this field. Most
    are self-explanatory, except for the <b>Menu</b> option. When this is
    selected, you must enter the path to a file on the Virtualmin system in
    the adjacent text box. Each line in the file must contain a code and 
    displayed text for an entry in the menu for this custom field, separated
    by spaces.<p>

<dt><b>In server list?</b>
<dd>If this is set to <b>Yes</b>, a column for this custom field will be shown
    on the <b>List Virtual Servers</b> page.<p>
