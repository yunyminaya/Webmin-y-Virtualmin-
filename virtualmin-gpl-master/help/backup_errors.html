<header>Action on error</header>

If the <b>Halt backup immediately</b> option is selected, any error encountered during the backup process (such as the failure of one feature) will cause the entire backup to halt. On the other hand, the <b>Continue</b> option will not halt the backup just because of a single failure. For automated backups this is superiour, as a partial backup is better than none at all. <p>

When set to <b>Continue</b> and purging of old backups is enabled, the purge
will still be done even if the backup fails. <p>
