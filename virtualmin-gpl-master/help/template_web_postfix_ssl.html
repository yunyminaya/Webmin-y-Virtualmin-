<header>Copy per-IP SSL certificates to Postfix?</header>

When this option is enabled and a virtual server is created with SSL enabled
and its own private IP, Dovecot will be configured to use the server's SSL
certificate for connections to that IP address. This can be useful if mail 
clients connect to the domain name in SSL mode, and expect a matching
certificate. <p>
