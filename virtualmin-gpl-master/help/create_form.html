<header>Create Virtual Server</header>

This form allows you to create a new top-level virtual server, which will have
a new associated administration login. When creating the server, you must
enter at least the domain name, description and administration password. If 
multiple server templates are defined on the system, you can select one from
the menu - templates determine various defaults for the new server, such as
the website configuration, DNS records and so on. <p>

Under the <b>Advanced options</b> section you can select a different
administration username, group name and database name for the server, rather
than the defaults which are taken from the first part of the domain name. 
A contact email address for the server can also be entered - ideally this
should be the existing address of the person who will manage the server,
in a different domain. <p>

To select which features are enabled for the server, use the checkboxes
in the second part of the <b>Advanced options</b> section. Some features
depend on others and cannot be selected on their own - for example, Webalizer
reporting on website statistics depends on actually having a website. <p>

At the bottom of the <b>Advanced options</b> section you can select to
have all web traffic to this new site forwarded to another URL, and to have
all email forwarded. You can also select to have the new virtual server use
its own private IP addresses, which is required for SSL and anonymous FTP
hosting. <p>
