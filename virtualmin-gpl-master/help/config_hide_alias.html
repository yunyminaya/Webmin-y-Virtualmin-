<header>Include alias virtual servers in menu?</header>

By default, the left-side menu in Virtualmin will include all virtual servers,
including aliases. However, if this option is set to <b>No</b>, alias servers
will be excluded from the list. This can be useful if your system hosts a
large number of aliases, such as for parked domains. You can still find and
manage these alias servers using the links from the Edit Virtual Server page
for their parents. <p>
