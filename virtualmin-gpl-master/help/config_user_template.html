<header>Template file for email to new mailboxes</header>
If new mailboxes created should automatically be sent a message, you may specify it here.  It can be the default, which can be edited using the <b>New Mailbox Email</b> page of Virtualmin, or you can provide another text file anywhere on the system.  Variable substitution using the following variables: ${MAILBOX}, ${USER}, ${DOM}, ${FTP}, and ${HOME}.  You may also use the special logic block operators $IF-MAIL...$ENDIF-MAIL and $IF-WEB...$ELSE-WEB...{$ENDIF-WEB} to allow your message to create an appropriate message based on the features the user has access to. If you are using DAV, the ${IF-VIRTUALMIN-DAV}..${ENDIF-VIRTUALMIN-DAV} block can be used to make different text appear depending on whether or not the user has DAV active. <p>
