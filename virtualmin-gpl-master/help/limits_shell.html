<header>Allowed login type</header>

This setting determines how the administrator for this domain is allowed to log
in, by modifying their Unix shell. The default available options are :<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Email only</b>
<dd>Both FTP and SSH logins are blocked, but POP3 and IMAP will work.
<dt><b>Email and FTP</b>
<dd>The user can connect via FTP, but not via SSH or telnet.
<dt><b>Email, FTP and SSH</b>
<dd>Logins via FTP, SSH and telnet are allowed.
</dl>
However, these can be customized by the master administrator on the
<b>Custom Shells</b> page. <p>

Because this feature works by changing the virtual server Unix user's shell, it
assumes that your FTP server uses the <tt>/etc/shells</tt> file for
authentication. <p>
