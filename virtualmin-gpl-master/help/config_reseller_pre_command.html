<header>Command to run before making changes to a reseller</header>

This option can be used to specify a script or command to be run before
a reseller is created, modified or deleted. It can make use of the
environment variables RESELLER_NAME and RESELLER_ACTION to determine
which reseller is being changed and what is happening to it. If the command
exits with a non-zero status, modification of the reseller will be vetoed. <p>
