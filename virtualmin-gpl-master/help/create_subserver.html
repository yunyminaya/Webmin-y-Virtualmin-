<header>Create Virtual Sub-Server</header>

This form allows you to create a new virtual sub-server, which is owned by an
existing administration login. A sub-server also shares disk quota, bandwidth
limits and limits on users, aliases and other objects with its parent. <p>

When creating the server, you must
enter at least the domain name and a description. If
multiple server templates are defined on the system, you can select one from
the menu - templates determine various defaults for the new server, such as
the website configuration, DNS records and so on. <p>

Under the <b>Advanced options</b> section you can select a different
initial database name, rather than using the default which is derived from
the domain name. The user and group names cannot be changed, as they are
always inherited from the parent server. <p>

To select which features are enabled for the server, use the checkboxes
in the second part of the <b>Advanced options</b> section. Some features
depend on others and cannot be selected on their own - for example, Webalizer
reporting on website statistics depends on actually having a website. <p>

At the bottom of the <b>Advanced options</b> section you can select to
have all web traffic to this new site forwarded to another URL, and to have
all email forwarded. You can also select to have the new virtual server use
its own private IP addresses, which is required for SSL and anonymous FTP
hosting. <p>
