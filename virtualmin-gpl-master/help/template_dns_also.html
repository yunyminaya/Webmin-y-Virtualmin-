<header>Automatically add named.conf directives</header>

By default, Virtualmin will automatically add <tt>also-notify</tt> and
<tt>allow-transfer</tt> blocks to a new domain's entry in the BIND
<tt>named.conf</tt> file to notify and allow transfers from known DNS
slaves. However, if you have these defined globally or at the view level
in your BIND configuration, you can un-check one or both of these checkboxes
to prevent Virtualmin from automatically adding those blocks. <p>
