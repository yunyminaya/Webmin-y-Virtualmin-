<header>Check email for spam and viruses?</header>

By default, when spam and virus filtering is enabled for a virtual server,
it will apply to all mailboxes in that domain. However you may want to
disable this for certain account, such as one that is setup to do spam
filtering on the client, or is the recipient of all spam for the domain.
To do this, change this option to <b>No</b>. <p>
