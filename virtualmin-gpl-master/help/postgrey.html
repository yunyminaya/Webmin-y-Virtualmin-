<header>Email Greylisting</header>

This page allows you to enable greylisting of incoming email on your mail
server, which reduces spam by forcing sending mail servers to re-try sending
the first time they are seen. Real mail servers will re-try after a short delay, but those operated by spammers typically will not. Thus legitimate email still gets delivered, but spam does not. <p>

When greylisting is enabled, this page will also show a list of client
mail servers and recipient email addresses that are excluded from greylisting.
You can edit one by clicking on it, or use the <b>Add</b> link to create
a new entry. Whitelist entries can be removed by checking the boxes
next to them and clicking the <b>Delete Selected</b> button at the bottom
of the page. <p>
