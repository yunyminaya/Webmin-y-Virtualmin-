<header>Server host for remote scanner</header>

This field should be used to enter the hostname of the remote system on
which <tt>clamd</tt> runs, to which virus-laden email messages will be sent
by <tt>clamdscan</tt> or <tt>clamd-stream-client</tt> for scanning. It has no
effect if you select <b>Standalone scanner</b> or <b>Local server scanner</b>
modes, as they both do the scanning locally. <p>
