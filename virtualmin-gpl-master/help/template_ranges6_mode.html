<header>Ranges for automatic IPv6 allocation</header>

In order to have an IPv6 address automatically allocated for a domain,
you need to enter a range of addresses to allocate from here. The starting and
ending addresses need to have the same prefix, like <tt>2001:db8:0:f101::20</tt>
to <tt>2001:db8:0:f101::50</tt>.
