<header>Maximum top-level servers</header>

This field allows you to impose a separate limit on the number of top-level
virtual servers the reseller can create. These are domains that have their own
administration login, not necessarily top-level DNS domains. Any limit on the
total number of virtual servers will also apply. <p>
