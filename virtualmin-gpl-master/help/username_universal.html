<header>Email address</header>

This field sets the username portion of the user's login,
which must be unique within the domain. The user's login for accessing services
such as SSH, FTP, email, database, and web-server authentication will be derived
from the username entered here, combined with the domain name. For example, if
you enter the username <tt>user1</tt> and the domain is <tt>example.com</tt>,
the resulting login will be <tt>user1@example.com</tt>. <p>
