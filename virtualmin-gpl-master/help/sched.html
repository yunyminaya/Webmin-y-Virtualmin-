<header>Scheduled Backups</header>

Virtualmin allows you to schedule the backup of some all all virtual servers
to local files or remote SSH or FTP servers, to be run at the times of your
choosing. This page lists all backups that you have permissions to manage,
and allows you to create new ones. <p>

For each backup shown, you can edit it's settings by clicking on the link
in the <b>Destination</b> column, or remove it by checking the box on the
left and hitting the <b>Delete</b> button. <p>

To run a scheduled backup right now, click the <b>Backup..</b> link on the 
right to bring up the backup form with it's details filled in. Or to restore
the most recent backup made using this schedule, click the <b>Restore..</b>
link. In both cases, you will have a chance to confirm what is to be done
before it goes ahead. <p>

You should not schedule multiple backups for the same domains that run at
the same time, as they may interfere with each other or run in an
inconsistent order.  <p>
