<header>Set group ownership of MySQL database files?</header>

When this option is enabled, any new MySQL databases will have group ownership
set on their data files (typically under <tt>/var/lib/mysql</tt>) so that they
are included in their virtual servers' Unix quota limits. If not enabled,
databases disk usage will not be restricted, and it will be possible for 
a virtual server to exceed its allowed disk allocation. <p>
