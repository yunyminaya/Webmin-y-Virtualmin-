<header>Create Alias Server</header>

This form allows you to create a new alias server, which is essentially an
alternative name for an existing server. Aliases do not have their own
website content, and share all quotas and limits with the target server.
Bandwidth used by the alias server is counted towards the target's total.<p>

When creating the server, you must
enter at least the domain name and a description. If
multiple server templates are defined on the system, you can select one from
the menu.

To select which features in the alias server are forwarded to the target
domain, use the checkboxes in the second part of the <b>Advanced options</b>
section. Only DNS, website and email aliasing are available. <p>
