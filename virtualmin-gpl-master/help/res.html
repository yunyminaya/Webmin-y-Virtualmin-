<header>Resource Limits</header>

This page allows you to define limits on CPU and memory use that apply
to this virtual server and all sub-servers. Limits apply to both PHP
scripts, and commands run via an SSH login. They can be used to prevent
any one domain owner from overloading the system with a fork bomb or
commands that use an excessive amount of RAM. <p>

The available limit types are :<br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Maximum number of processes</b>
<dd>Attempting to launch more processes running as the server's Unix user
    than the limit set here will fail. This applies to concurrent PHP scripts
    too.<p>

<dt><b>Maximum size per process</b>
<dd>Any single process that tries to allocate more memory that this limit will
    be terminated. However, the sum total of all processes owned by the server
    can still exceed the limit.<p>

<dt><b>Maximum CPU time per process</b>
<dd>Any process whose time spent actually using the CPU (not waiting for IO
    or sleeping) exceeds this limit will be killed.<p>
</dl>
