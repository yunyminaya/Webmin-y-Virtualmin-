<header>Create Virtual Sub-Domain</header>

This form allows you to create a new virtual sub-domain, which is owned by an
existing administration login. A sub-domain is similar to a sub-server, in that
it shares disk quota, bandwidth limits and limits on users, aliases and other
objects with its parent. However, the sub-domain's name must be under the
name of the parent domain, it uses a sub-directory of the parent's 
<tt>public_html</tt> directory for its website, and log files are shared.<p>

When creating the server, you must
enter at least the domain name and a description. If
multiple server templates are defined on the system, you can select one from
the menu - templates determine various defaults for the new server, such as
the website configuration, DNS records and so on. <p>

To select which features are enabled for the server, use the checkboxes
in the second part of the <b>Advanced options</b> section. Sub-domains have
a much smaller set of available features compared to sub-servers or top-level
servers. <p>

At the bottom of the <b>Advanced options</b> section you can select to
have all web traffic to this new site forwarded to another URL.
You can also select to have the new virtual server use
its own private IP addresses, which is required for SSL and anonymous FTP
hosting. <p>
