<header>Show databases in users list?</header>

When this is set to <b>Yes</b>, the number of databases to which
each user has access will be displayed in a separate column on the
<b>Edit Users</b> page. This feature provides a quick overview of database
accessibility for each user, complementing the information already
available in the "Login access" column. Opting for <b>No</b> will
hide "Databases?" column from the user list.<p>
