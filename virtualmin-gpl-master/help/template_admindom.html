<header>URL for admin redirect</header>

By default, Virtualmin will redirect requests to <tt>http://admin.thedomain.com</tt> to Webmin on the same system, like <tt>https://thedomain.com:10000/</tt>. However, this field can be used to change the redirect URL, perhaps to a single hostname for all your domains for which you have an SSL certificate, like
<tt>https://yourcompany.com:10000/</tt>. <p>
