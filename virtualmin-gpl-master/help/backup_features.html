<header>Features to backup</header>

These checkboxes control which information about each virtual server is included in the backup. Typically you will want to include everything, and so all of the feature boxes should be checked. <p>

Some features may have additional options next to them, to control in more detail what is included in the backup. For example, you can choose whether or not the <tt>logs</tt> directory under each server's home is included, as logs often take up a large amount of disk space, and may not be considered important enough to save. <p>

Be aware that when backing up a server, no information about any sub-servers will be included unless you specifically select them. <p>
