<header>Can see mailbox and virtual server passwords?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, server administrators will be able to
see the current passwords for mail / FTP users and their own virtual server,
when they are known to Virtualmin. You may want to select <b>No</b> to hide
mailbox passwords, particularly those that have been selected by mailbox
users. <p>

Regardless of this setting, the master administrator and resellers will always
be able to see mailbox and virtual server passwords. <p>
