<header>Source URL path</header>

This field sets the URL that will be redirected, which is always a path
in the selected virtual server. So if you were to enter <tt>/google</tt>
here and your domain was <tt>example.com</tt>, the URL being redirected would
be <tt>http://www.example.com/google</tt>. <p>
