<header>PHP Versions</header>

This page allows you to select the version of PHP used by default in this
virtual server, and also to choose different versions for different
web sub-directories. This can be useful if you have PHP applications that
will only work with a specific version. <p>

To change the version used by default, select it from the menu next to the
<b><i>Default HTML directory</i></b> row, and click <b>Save</b>. Similarly,
to change the version used by some other directory, select it from the menu
next to that directory's row. <p>

To add a custom PHP version for a new directory, enter its relative path
into the text field at the bottom of the table, select a version from the 
menu at the bottom, and click <b>Save</b>. This path must be relative to
<tt>public_html</tt>, like <i>wordpress</i> or <i>mediawiki</i>. There is
no need for a leading / , or a full URL. <p>

To reset a directory to use the default version of PHP, select the checkbox
next to it in the table and click the <b>Remove Selected</b> button. <p>
