<header>Initially selected template for top-level servers?</header>

When this is set to <b>Yes</b>, the template menu when creating a new top
level virtual server will have this template selected by default. It will also be used
when creating a server from the command line if no template is explictly
specified with the <tt>--template</tt> parameter. Only one template can
have this set to <b>Yes</b> at a time. <p>
