<header>Hide limits from server owners?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, any limits imposed on this
reseller in the number of domains, aliases or other objects that his
virtual server owner customers can create will be not displayed to those
server owners. Limits will still be enforced, but will only be apparent
when they are hit. <p>
