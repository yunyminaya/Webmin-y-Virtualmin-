<header>Force mailbox usernames to lower case?</header>

When this field is set to <b>Yes</b> (as it is by default), all mail / FTP
users will have their usernames forced to lower case, regardless of what
case they are created in. If you want to prevent this behaviour, select
<b>No</b> to have mailboxes created with the exact case entered. Be aware
that for logging into Usermin and any POP3, IMAP or FTP server, the correct
case must be used. <p>

Because most mail servers cannot handle delivery to users with non-lowercase
names, this option should always be left set to <b>Yes</b> unless you are
creating accounts for FTP, DAV or SVN use. <p>
