<header>Can choose database names?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, the owner of this virtual server
will be allowed to select the default name for databases for new sub-servers
he creates. You should only set it to <b>No</b> if you want complete control
over the names of databases on your system. <p>
