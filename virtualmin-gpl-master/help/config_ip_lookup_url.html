<header>HTTP service URL for system external IP detection</header>

This option specifies the HTTP service URL used to detect the systemâ€™s external
IP address. It queries a web service to retrieve the public IP of this system.
By default, the URL is set to
<tt>https://software.virtualmin.com/cgi-bin/ip.cgi</tt>.<p>

You can also use other services like <tt>https://ifconfig.me</tt> or
<tt>https://icanhazip.com</tt>. Furthermore, you can specify separate URLs for
IPv4 and IPv6 detection by separating them with a space, such as
<tt>https://api.ipify.org https://api6.ipify.org</tt>.<p>
