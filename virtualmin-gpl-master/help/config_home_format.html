<header>Home subdirectory</header>
New domains (that are not owned by existing domain owners) will reside in a subdirectory within the home directory specified above.  By default, the directory name will match the username and will reside directly in the base directory.  You can also specify some special directory name, if for example, you'd like to keep standard system users separate from domain account users.  In such a case, you might place the Virtualmin domains in "/home/domains/$USER".
