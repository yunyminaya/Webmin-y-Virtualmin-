<header>Disk Quota Monitoring</header>

This page can be used to set up regular automatic checking of virtual servers
that have reached or are approaching their disk quotas. It is most useful on
systems that do not have group quota support, and thus depend on manual
enforcement to ensure that servers do not use more than their allowed disk
space. <p>

It is also handy even on systems with group quotas, as the <b>Send warning when usage reaches</b> field can be used to enter a list of percentage thresholds (separated by spaces) at which warning email will be sent when they are passed. This allows the system administrator to catch excessive or rapidly growing disk usage early.
