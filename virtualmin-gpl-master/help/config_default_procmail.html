<header>Allow mailbox users to create mail filters?</header>

When this option is set to <b>No</b>, Procmail will be configured to not
execute the <tt>.procmailrc</tt> files in users' home directories, which prevents any
mail filters, auto-responders or forwards created by users from running. This has
some security benefits, as it prevents mailbox users from running commands
via Procmail. <p>
