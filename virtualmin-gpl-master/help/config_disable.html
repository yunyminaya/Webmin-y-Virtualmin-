<header>Features to deactivate when disabling</header>

Virtualmin allows you to disable a domain account without deleting it or otherwise removing user data.  You can choose to leave some services active (like email), if you want to be able to disable an account for some reason, such as past due bills or violation of terms of service, but do not want to cause the customer serious heartache due to lost mail.  You may disable any or all features.<p>
