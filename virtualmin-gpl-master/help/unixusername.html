<header>Administration username</header>

This is the username of the owner of the domain. If you leave it set to 
<b>Automatic</b> the name will be the same as the first part of the domain
name or the entire domain. Alternately, you can select to enter a custom
username of your choice. <p>

This login will typically be able to login via SSH and FTP, and manage the
virtual server via the web interface. The password for all these services
will be whatever was entered in the <b>Administration password</b> field.
An email address with this username will also be created in the virtual server
if it has mail enabled. <p>
