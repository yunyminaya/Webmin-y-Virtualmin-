<header>Automatically delete trash?</header>

This option can be used to have email in mail users' trash folders in virtual
servers created with this template automatically
deleted once it becomes too old or exceeds a certain size. Only trash that 
exceeds whatever size or age criteria you set here will be removed, and checking
is done once per day around midnight. <p>
