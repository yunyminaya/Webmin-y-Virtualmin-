<header>Shared IP Addresses</header>

The primary purpose of this page is for entering additional IP addresses that
can be used by virtual servers that do not have their own private IPs. Each
IP entered must be already active on the system (which can be done in the
Webmin module Network Configuration), and cannot be used by any other
reseller or private IP virtual server. <p>
