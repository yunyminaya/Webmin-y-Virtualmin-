<header>Minimum recommended real memory</header>

During a configuration check, Virtualmin compares the total memory your system
has with the recommended amount entered here, and displays a warning if memory
is too low. If you are confident that your system can operate with less than
the default threshold of 256 MB, you can lower the value in this field. <p>
