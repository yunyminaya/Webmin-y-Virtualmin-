<header>Action if destination is in use</header>

This option determines what will happen if a Virtualmin backup to the same
destination is already in progress. The <b>Cancel this backup</b> option will
allow the running backup to complete, and immediately fail this one. The
<b>Kill the running backup</b> will terminate the backup that is already
executing, allowing this one to start. This can be useful to prevent a stuck
backup from blocking all others that would follow it. <p>
