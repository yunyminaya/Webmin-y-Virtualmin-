<header>Maximum Mongrel server processes for Rails</header>

When installing Ruby on Rails scripts, the server administrator can select
how my Mongrel server processes to start to handle requests to the script's
path - if the Apache <tt>mod_proxy_balancer</tt> module is installed. To
prevent an excessive number of Mongrel server processes from overloading the
system, this option can be used to limit the number that domain administrators
are allowed to configure from within Virtualmin. <p>
