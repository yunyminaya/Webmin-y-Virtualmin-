<header>MySQL Database Server (for database)</header>
If enabled, the domain owner account will have access to the MySQL Webmin module.  It provides a friendly GUI to the databases that belong to the domain owner.  With this module, and appropriate privileges, the domain owner can create new databases, edit existing databases, or perform queries on the data within the database.
