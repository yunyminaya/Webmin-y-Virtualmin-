<header>Deliver to this user normally</header>

When this option is checked, email to this user will be delivered to their
mailbox after passing through any spam filtering. Normally, you donâ€™t need to
check this, as it happens automatically if no forwarding or autoreply is set up.
However, if you do set up a forwarding address or automatic reply but still want
the user to keep a copy of their email, this option should be selected. <p>
