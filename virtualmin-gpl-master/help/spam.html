<header>Setup spam filtering?</header>

When this feature is enabled, email sent to all users of this virtual
server will be checked for spam and either deleted, delivered to the user's
spam folder or delivered normally, depending on the Virtualmin configuration.
In the latter case, email clasified as spam will still be tagged in the headers,
so that it can be processed by users' mail clients. <p>
