<header>ProFTPd IP-based virtual server enabled?</header>
Enables or disables a new FTP virtual host.  Note that FTP requires a new IP for anonymous virtual domain hosting.  The vast majority of website owners do not need this feature, and it is not required for authenticated FTP access to the domain owners files.  However, if some domains will require virtual hosted anonymous FTP access (i.e. if they are operating an FTP file server for software or file downloads for non-logged in users), you may wish to set it to "Yes, but not by default".
