<header>Webserver access log file</header>

This field sets the file to which Apache access logs are written for this
virtual server. Each HTTP request served by this website's domain will be
written to this file as a separate line. It should only be changed if you
are moving logging to a different directory, such as
<tt>/var/log/virtualmin</tt> or the server's home directory. <p>
