<header>Default delivery for spam</header>
If SpamAssassin is enabled for user accounts, messages that have been judged to be spam by the processor
can be delivered (with optional marking, configured in the SpamAssassin module), deleted, or delivered to
a special folder named Spam within the users mail directory.  While false positives are extremely rare
with SpamAssassin in its default configuration, it may be wise to retain messages for some period of time
and allow users to check the spam folder using Usermin webmail, or via IMAP folders (if IMAP is available
to your users). The default is to put spam into the Spam Maildir folder.<p>
