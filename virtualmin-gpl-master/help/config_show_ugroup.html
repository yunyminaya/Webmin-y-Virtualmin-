<header>Allow selection of different group for server admins?</header>

When this option is set to Yes, the creator of a new virtual server can
select a different Unix group for its owner to be a member of, instead of
the new group created for the virtual server. This can be useful if you
need all of the server owner accounts on your system to be members of
a particular group, but should be used with care as it can allow server
owners to evade group quotas. <p>
