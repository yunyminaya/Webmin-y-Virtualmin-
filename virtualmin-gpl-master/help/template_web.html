<header>Directives and settings for new websites</header>

It is possible to completely customize the Apache directives that are added when a new virtual server is created.  Variable substitution is performed for all of the standard Virtualmin template variables.  Care should be taken with Apache directives, as some present security issues.  The Apache documentation and to a lesser degree the Apache sections of the Webmin documentation can be consulted to find more details about Apache configuration.<p>
