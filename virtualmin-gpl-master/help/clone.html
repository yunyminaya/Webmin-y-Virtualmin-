<header>Clone Virtual Server</header>

This page allows you to duplicate an existing virtual server with a new
domain name. Any web content, DNS records, mailboxes, mail aliases, databases
and other settings associated with the original domain will be duplicated,
where possible. However, web content will <b>not</b> be changed in any way,
so if the virtual server contains a web application that has been configured
to use the old server's databases or home directory, it will need to be
manually re-configured after cloning. <p>

When duplicating a top-level virtual server you must also enter a new username
and password to own the new domain. If the server has a private IP address,
a new IP will be automatically allocated for the clone. <p>

The cloning process will copy any databases associated with the original
domain under new names, and duplicate their contents. However, it may not
update all web apps installed into the original domain that are configured to
use the original databases. This has to be done manually. <p>
