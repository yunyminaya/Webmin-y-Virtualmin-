<header>Request wildcard Let's Encrypt certificate?</header>

When requesting a Let's Encrypt certificate as part of the domain creation
process, this option determines if it will be a wildcard cert that matches
all sub-domains, or a regular certificate. This is only possible if the domain
has the DNS feature enabled. <p>
