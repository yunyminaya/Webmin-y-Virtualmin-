<header>Path to create API helper command</header>

By default, Virtualmin will create the <tt>virtualmin</tt> command-line API
helper script in the <tt>/usr/sbin</tt> or <tt>/usr/local/sbin</tt> directory,
depending on which is writable on your system. However, this configuration
field can be used to select a different location, such as
<tt>/opt/bin/virtualmin</tt> that is appropriate for your site. <p>
