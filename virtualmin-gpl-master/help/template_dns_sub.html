<header>Add sub-domain DNS records to parent domain?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, sub-domain virtual servers will have
their DNS records added to the existing DNS zone for the parent domain,
if one exists. This avoids the creation of an extra DNS zone that is not
strictly necessary, and reduces the number of zone transfers to slave DNS
servers. <p>
