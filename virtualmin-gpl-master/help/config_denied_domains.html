<header>Regular expressions for disallowed domains</header>

If you have certain domain names that server owners or resellers should not
be allowed to create (such as sub-domains of your company's domain), then they
can be listed in this field. Domains must be given as Perl-style regular
expressions, so to deny any sub-domain under <i>foo.com</i> you should enter
<i>.*\.foo\.com</i>. <p>
