<header>Cloud Mail Delivery Providers</header>

This page allows you to configure SMTP providers that will forward your outgoing
email, rather than having your Virtualmin system deliver it directly. This is
necessary when sending email from some cloud hosting providers, and can 
reduce the chance of your mail being classified as spam. <p>
