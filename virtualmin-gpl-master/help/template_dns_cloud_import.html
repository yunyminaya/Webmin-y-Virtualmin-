<header>Take over existing zone when creating?</header>

If a Cloud DNS provider is selected, this option determines what happens 
if a new domain already exists at the provider. If <b>No</b> is selected,
domain creation will fail. But if <b>Yes</b> is chosen, the existing domain
will be used and managed by Virtualmin. <p>
