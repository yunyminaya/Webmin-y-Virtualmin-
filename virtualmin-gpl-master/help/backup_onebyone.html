<header>Transfer each virtual server after it is backed up</header>

If this box is checked and you are performing a backup to a remote FTP or
SSH server in the new format, the file for each virtual server will be
transfered after it is created. This saves on local disk space, but runs
the risk of transferring an incomplete backup if some virtual servers fail. <p>
