<header>Proxy Paths</header>

Proxying allows you to map a URL path in a virtual server's website
to one or more destination URLs. This is typically used to make Ruby on Rails
applications served by multiple Mongrel instances available under a URL
path in the server's website. It can also be used to make other webservers
such as Tomcat available via a URL path on your website. <p>

For example, you might map the path <tt>/radiant</tt> to the URLs <tt>http://localhost:3001</tt> and <tt>http://localhost:3002</tt>, which are the ports for
two Mongrel instances serving the same application running on your Virtualmin
system. <p>

Only systems that have the <tt>mod_proxy_balancer</tt> Apache module installed
can map a path to multiple URLs. Others that only support Apache's regular
proxy module can forward a path to just a single URL. <p>
