<header>Allow automatic BCCing of outgoing email?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, you will be able to configure each
virtual server so that email sent by its mail users is BCCd to a separate
address. However, this will only work when the Postfix mail server is being
used and if the <tt>sender_bcc_maps</tt> directive is set in its
<tt>main.cf</tt> file. <p>

If Postfix also has the <tt>recipient_bcc_maps</tt> directive set, you will
also have the option to set an address for BCCing incoming messages. <p>
