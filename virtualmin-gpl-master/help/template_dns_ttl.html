<header>Default TTL for DNS records</header>

This field allows you to set the time-to-live for DNS records created by
Virtualmin, which is the time that they are cached by other DNS clients and
servers on the Internet. You may want to adjust this if Webmin's default
setting of 86400 seconds (1 day) is too long, perhaps because you expect
DNS records to change often.<p>
