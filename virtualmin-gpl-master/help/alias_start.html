<header>Automatic reply start date</header>

When <b>Any time</b> is selected (as it is by default), Virtualmin will
send an automatic reply regardless of the date email was received. However, you
can select <b>On date</b> and enter a date into the adjacent fields to prevent
autoreplies from being sent before that day. This can be useful when setting up
an autoreponder for someone who is going on vacation on a known date.<p>
