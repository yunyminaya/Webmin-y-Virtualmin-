<header>DMARC record enabled?</header>

A DMARC record tells other mail servers that receive email from this domain
what action should be taken if a message fails DKIM or SPF
validation. Before DMARC the behavior in this case was poorly specified, so
a DMARC record allows a domain owner to request rejection or quarantining of
some or all invalid messages. <p>
