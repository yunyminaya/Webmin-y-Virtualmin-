<header>Create DNSSEC key and sign new domains?</header>

When this option is enabled, Virtualmin will create a DNSSEC key for any new
virtual server DNS domains, and use it to sign their records. Any time records
are changed using Webmin or Virtualmin, the signatures will be automatically
updated to match. <p>

For DNSSEC to be truly useful, the public key for any new domains must be
submitted to the registrar or owner of the parent DNS domain. <p>
