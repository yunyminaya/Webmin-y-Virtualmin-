<header>SpamAssassin Mail Filter (for domains config file)</header>
If enabled, the domain owner will have access to the SpamAssassin configuration
module for their domain. This allows them to customize SpamAssassinâ€™s policies.
However, inexperienced users might find this level of control overwhelming and
could unintentionally increase false positives or reduce the effectiveness of
the spam filter.
