<header>Files to exclude from each domain</header>
<p>This field allows you to enter a list of relative paths to files under each
virtual server's home directory to exclude from this backup. To exclude multiple paths,
put each on its own line (e.g. separated by linefeeds).</p>
<p>
<b>Examples</b>
</p>
<p>
To exclude an entire directory, provide the relative path from the user's home directory,
such as <tt>public_html/stats</tt> to exclude the Webalizer reports directory or
<tt>homes</tt> to exclude user home directories.
</p>
<p>
To exclude a single file, provide the relative path to the filename, such as 
<tt>public_html/index.html</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Files can also be specified using wildcards, such as <tt>*.log</tt>, which will exclude 
any file with the <tt>.log</tt> file extension anywhere within the home directory of 
the domain. A path can also be provided, such as <tt>etc/*.ini</tt> to exclude all
files ending in <tt>.ini</tt>.
