<header>Home directory creation enabled?</header>

This option determines if the creation of a home directory for a new
virtual server is always done (and the option hidden), or if it is optional
when creating a server. Because a home directory is almost always needed
unless you are creating a DNS-only domain, the <b>Always</b> option is
generally the best. <p>
