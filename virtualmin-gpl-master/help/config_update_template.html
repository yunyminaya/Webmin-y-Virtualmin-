<header>Template file for email to updated mailboxes</header>

If mailboxes should automatically be sent a message when they are updated, you may specify it here.  It can be the default, which can be edited using the <b>Updated Mailbox Email</b> page of Virtualmin, or you can provide another text file anywhere on the system.  Variable substitution using the following variables: ${MAILBOX}, ${USER}, ${DOM}, ${FTP}, and ${HOME}.  You may also use the special logic block operators $IF-MAIL...$ENDIF-MAIL and $IF-WEB...$ELSE-WEB...{$ENDIF-WEB} to allow your message to create an appropriate message based on the features the user has access to.<p>
