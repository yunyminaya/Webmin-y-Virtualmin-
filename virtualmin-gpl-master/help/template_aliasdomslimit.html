<header>Limit on number of alias servers</header>

If the domain owner has sub-server creation privileges, you may limit the number of alias servers that can be created here. Note that this limit cannot be effectively higher than the <b>Default limit on number of virtual servers</b>, as the overall limit on virtual servers applies to both alias and non-alias domains.
A limit of <tt>0</tt> prevents the creation of alias domains completely. <p>
