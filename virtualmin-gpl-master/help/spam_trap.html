<header>Create spamtrap and hamtrap email aliases?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, Virtualmin will create mail aliases
named <tt>spamtrap</tt> and <tt>hamtrap</tt> for this domain. Users can then
forward spam that gets through the SpamAssassin mail filter to the
<tt>spamtrap</tt> address, which will then be used to train SpamAssassin's
learning engine. Similarly, email that is incorrectly classified as spam can
be forwarded to the <tt>hamtrap</tt> address. <p>
