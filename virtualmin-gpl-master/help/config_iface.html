<header>Network interface for virtual addresses</header>

If your server has multiple interfaces, you may choose which interface to use for your virtual domains.  If SSL or FTP virtual hosts are enabled, a new IP will be required for each domain on which the feature is enabled.  Unless configured otherwise during domain creation, the new addresses will be created on the interface specified here.
