<header>FTP Directory Restrictions</header>

This page allows you to configure which directories virtual server owners and
users with FTP access can see when logging in via FTP. By default, FTP
clients can access the entire filesystem, including directories like
<tt>/etc</tt> and <tt>/home</tt>. However, this may give away information
that you'd prefer users not to be able to see. <p>

Each row in the table on this page defines the virtual server or servers to
match, and the directory they are limited to. In the <b>Apply to server and
sub-servers</b> column, you can either choose all virtual servers, or a single
domain (which will include all it's sub-servers automatically). If the latter
option is chosen and the <b>All except server</b> box is checked, the
restriction will effect servers other than the one chosen. <p>

The <b>Restrict to directory</b> column determines where matching virtual
servers are limited to when logging in via FTP. The most commonly used option
is <b>Users' home directories</b>, which will limit the domain owner to 
the virtual server's home, and any FTP users to their own sub-directories,
typically under <tt>homes</tt>. <p>

<hr>

In a standard Virtualmin installation, every domain's home directory has
<tt>750</tt> permissions, which prevents users from other domains accessing
it, regardless of FTP directory restrictions. So locking down FTP users on
this page does not add that much to the security of your system. <p>

In addition, the restrictions on this page do not apply to PHP scripts, CGI
programs or virtual server owners logging in via SSH. At the present time,
there is no way to lock them down, although home directory permissions do
still apply. <p>
