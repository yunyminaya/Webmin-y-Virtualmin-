<header>Use default IPv6 address for new virtual servers?</header>

By default Virtualmin will add DNS entries and a webserver configuration to new
virtual servers to use the system's primary IPv6 address. At creation time
a user can still select to use a private IPv6 address or none at all though. <p>
