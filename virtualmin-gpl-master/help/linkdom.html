<header>Domain name for use in links</header>

By default when Virtualmin displays a link to this virtual server's website
(such as after installing a script), it will use the server's domain name.
However, you can instead use this field to select an alias domain to use in
links instead. This can be useful if the server is only externally accessible
via the alias domain name. <p>
