<header>Quota for administration user</header>

The owner of a domain is just like a normal user account, in that it can receive email, and disk space usage quotas can be applied, as well.  The files within the domain website will normally be owned by the user, so it may be useful to specify website size using this quota, while allowing the total quota for the entire server to limit the total used for mail and website data belonging to all users within the domain.
