<header>Address records for new domains</header>

This field allows you to select which DNS <tt>A</tt> (address) records
Virtualmin will add to new domains. The default setup in which they are
all added will work fine in all cases, but you can de-select some records
if they are un-needed or clash with sub-domains. <p>
