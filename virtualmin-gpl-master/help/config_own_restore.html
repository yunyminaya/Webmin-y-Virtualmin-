<header>Can restore backups made by master admin?</header>

By default, virtual server owners can only restore backups that they made
themselves. However, if this setting is changed to <b>Yes</b>, backups made
by the master administrator (<tt>root</tt>) can also be restored by domain
owners. Naturally this only applies to their own domains though. <p>

You should only enable this option if you are sure that all your backup
destinations are secure, as restoring a backup made by an un-trusted user
could compromise system security. <p>
