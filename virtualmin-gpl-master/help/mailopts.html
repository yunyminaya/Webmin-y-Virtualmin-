<header>Email Settings</header>

This page is for configuring email-related settings for a virtual server.
If your system supports BCCing sent email (and it is enabled on the Module
Config page), the <b>BCC outgoing email to</b> section can be used to select
an address to copy mail to. <p>

If the virtual server is an alias domain, the <b>Mail aliases mode</b> field
controls if mail aliases are copied from the target domain, or if a single
catchall alias is created to forward all email to the target. The former 
mode is not available with all mail servers, but is superior when using Postfix
as it allows mail to invalid addresses to be bounced at the SMTP conversation
level. <p>
