<header>IPv6 Network Interface</header>

If you want this virtual server to have an IPv6 address as well as IPv4,
this field can be used to either have an address automatically allocated, if
v6 allocation ranges have been defined. If no ranges have been setup in the server
template, you can enter an IPv6 address manually.<p>
