<header>Create Mailbox</header>

This page is for creating local mailboxes.  These mailboxes will be for addresses in the default domain of the server, rather than a virtual domain hosted on the server.  Mailboxes for virtual domains are created in the second section of the module index page.
<p>
When creating a new local mailbox only the username, real name, and password are required.
