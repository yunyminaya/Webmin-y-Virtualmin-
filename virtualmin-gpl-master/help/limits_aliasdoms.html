<header>Maximum allowed aliases</header>

This field sets a limit on the number of aliases that the server owner can
create. It is often used in conjunction with the "Maximum allowed sub-servers"
option to give the user permission to create a higher or unlimited number of
aliases for their domains, while still limiting the number of sub-servers. <p>
