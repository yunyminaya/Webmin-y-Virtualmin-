<header>Allow DNS sub-domains with a different owner?</header>

By default, Virtualmin will only put DNS records into a super-domain BIND zone
if they have the same owner. However, you can allow zone sharing regardless of
ownership by setting this option to <b>Yes</b>. This is only recommended when
the owner of the sub-domain can fully trust the super-domain owner. <p>
