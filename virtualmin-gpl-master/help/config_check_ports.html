<header>Can listen on unexpected ports?</header>

Virtualmin has the ability to check for server processes run by domain owners that
listen on TCP ports that are not associated with a known script or FPM pool.
This option determines if these servers are just ignored, if they are allowed
but included in the validation report, or if they are automatically terminated.
<p>

Servers running on unexpected ports can be dangerous, as they may allow a 
rouge domain owner to capture network traffic meant for another domain. <p>
