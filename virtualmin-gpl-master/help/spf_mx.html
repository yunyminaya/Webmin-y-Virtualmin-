<header>Allowed sender mail domains</header>

This field lists domain names whose mail servers (identified by DNS MX
records) are allowed to send email from this domain. Because mail servers
for a domain often change, it is recommended that you enter domain names
here rather than mail server hostnames in the <b>Allowed sender hostnames</b>
field, where appropriate. <p>
