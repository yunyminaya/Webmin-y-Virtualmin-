<header>Other groups to which users can be assigned</header>

This field can be used to enter Unix groups to which users can be assigned.
This can be useful in other applications that perform access control by group,
or to grant access to files that users would not normally be able to manage.
It should be used with care though, as giving server owners the ability to
assign users to the <tt>root</tt> or <tt>bin</tt> groups would be a serious
security risk. <p>
