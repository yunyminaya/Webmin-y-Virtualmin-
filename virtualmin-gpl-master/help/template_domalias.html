<header>Automatically create alias domain</header>

This option can be used to have an additional alias domain created for each
new virtual server, under some other domain. It can be useful when adding
a new server for which the DNS domain has not been registered yet, so that it
can be accessed under a temporary name that is under one that is already
registered (such as your company's). <p>
