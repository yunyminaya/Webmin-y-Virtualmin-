<header>Alias name</header>

This field determines the part of the alias email address to the left of the
@. You can either select the <b>Mailbox</b> option and enter a specific
mailbox name (like <i>sales</i>), or choose <b>All mailboxes</b> to have the
alias catch email sent to any address at the domain which does not match
any other user or alias. <p>
