<header>Allow server-side includes by default?</header>

Server-side includes are a webserver feature that allows simple macro directives
to be used in HTML files. They can be used to include other HTML files, set and
displaying the contents of variables, and control what content appears on the
page with <tt>if</tt> statements. They offer a simpler way of creating dynamic
pages than a full scripting language like PHP or Perl. <p>

This setting determines if new virtual servers will have SSI enabled after
creation, disabled, or left to use the global default settings for your
webserver. <p>
