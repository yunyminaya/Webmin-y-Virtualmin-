<header>Group for Administration User</header>

By default, the group for the Unix user who is created to own this domain's
files will be the same as the group for its mail users. However, you can
select an existing group on the server instead, which can be useful if
you have some kind of group-based access restrictions in force (such as
for FTP).  <p>
