<header>Allow use of server-side includes?</header>

Server-side includes are a webserver feature that allows simple macro directives
to be used in HTML files. They can be used to include other HTML files, set and
displaying the contents of variables, and control what content appears on the
page with <tt>if</tt> statements. They offer a simpler way of creating dynamic
pages than a full scripting language like PHP or Perl. <p>
