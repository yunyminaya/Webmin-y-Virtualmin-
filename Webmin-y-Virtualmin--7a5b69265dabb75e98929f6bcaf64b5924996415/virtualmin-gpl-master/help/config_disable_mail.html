<header>When disabling email</header>

This option lets you decide if disabling a domain should shut off mail delivery
to all mailboxes, or just lock accounts to that mail users cannot login via
SMTP, Usermin or IMAP. Turning off mail delivery will cause email to bounce,
which may be too aggressive for some admins. <p>
