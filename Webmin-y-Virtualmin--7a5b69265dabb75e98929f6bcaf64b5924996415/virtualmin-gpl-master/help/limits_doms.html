<header>Maximum allowed sub-servers and aliases</header>

This field sets a limit on the number of sub-servers and aliases in total that
this user can create. If the <em>Cannot create</em> option is selected, the user
will not be allowed to add any at all. The parent server, sub-servers and all aliases,
are included in the count towards this limit. <p>
