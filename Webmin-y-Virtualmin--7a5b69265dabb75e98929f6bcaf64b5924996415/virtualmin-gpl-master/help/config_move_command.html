<header>Command to run to move a domain's home directory</header>

By default, Virtualmin will just use the <tt>mv</tt> command to move a domain's
home directory when needed, such as when a domain is renamed. However, this may
not be appropriate in cases where each virtual server is on it's own filesystem,
such as a ZFS mount. <p>

In cases like this, you can set this field to a command or script that will
be passed the old and new home directories as parameters. It will also have
access to all the environment variables normally passed to pre- and post-
modification commands. <p>
