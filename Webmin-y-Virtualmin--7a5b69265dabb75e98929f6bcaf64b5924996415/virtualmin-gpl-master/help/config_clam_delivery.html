<header>Default delivery for viruses</header>
If ClamAV marks a message as containing a virus, it can be deleted or delivered to a special folder named
Virus, within the users mail directory.  Deleting emails containing viruses is generally recommended, and
false positives in the default ClamAV configuration are extremely unlikely. The default is to delete
messages containing viruses.
