<header>Validate Virtual Servers</header>

This page can be used to have Virtualmin check that all virtual servers
are in the state it expects them to have. It will compare underlying Apache,
BIND, Postfix and other config files with the settings for the selected
servers, and report any mis-matches found. It can be useful for finding
problems introduced by manually editing configurations, or Virtualmin bugs.
<p>

You can choose which servers to validate with the <b>Servers to check</b>,
and which features within those to examine with the <b>Features to check</b>
list. <p>
