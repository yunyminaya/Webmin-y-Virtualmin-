<header>Can forward email to non-local domains?</header>

By default, domain owners can forward email to any address they want. However,
some email services like Gmail will classify forwarded messages as spam, which
can effect the reputation of your system. This option can be used to limit
forwarding to locally hosted domains only. <p>
