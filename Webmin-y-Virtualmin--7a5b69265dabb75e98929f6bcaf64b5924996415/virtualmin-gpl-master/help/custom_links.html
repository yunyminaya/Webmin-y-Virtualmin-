<header>Custom Links</header>

Custom fields allow the administrator to include additional links that appear
in the left frame when a virtual server is selected. Links can be edited by
clicking on their title in the list on this page, or created with the <b>Add</b>
link. <p>

Links can be re-ordered using the arrows in the <b>Move</b> column, if you
have defined more than one.<p>

<hr>

At the bottom of the page is a form for entering or modifying categories
for custom links. These are displayed as expandable sections in the framed
themes, with the links chosen to be in each category appearing under the 
section header when it is open. <p>
