<header>Maximum connections for domain owners</header>

This field controls the number of concurrent connections to MySQL that a
virtual server owner's account can make. This includes connections from
web apps installed by Virtualmin, such as Wordpress or Drupal. The default
is to allow an unlimited number of connections, but because each consumes
memory within the MySQL server process you may want to limit total connections
on a busy system. <p>

The limit set here will only be applied when a new virtual server is created,
or when a MySQL login is enabled for an existing server. <p>
