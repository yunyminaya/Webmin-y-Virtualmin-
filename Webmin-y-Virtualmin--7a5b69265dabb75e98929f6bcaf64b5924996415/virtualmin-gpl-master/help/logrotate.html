<header>Setup log file rotation?</header>

If this option is enabled, the virtual server's web log files will be
rotated on a weekly basis, to avoid consuming too much disk space. Each week
the current log file will be copied, truncated and compressed. By default,
rotated logs will be kept for up to five weeks before being deleted. <p>
