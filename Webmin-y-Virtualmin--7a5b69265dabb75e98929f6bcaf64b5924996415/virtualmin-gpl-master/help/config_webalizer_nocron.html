<header>Setup Webalizer Cron job for each virtual server?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b> (as it is by default), Virtualmin will create a separate Cron job for each virtual server that has Webalizer enabled, in order to generate a report from its logs on a daily basis. <p>

However, on a server with a large number of domains you may instead want to
change this option to <b>No</b>, and instead manually schedule the command
<tt>/usr/libexec/webmin/virtual-server/run-all-webalizer.pl</tt> using Cron.
This will ensure that Webalizer is run for each domain in turn rather than
potentially having multiple domains processed at the same time, and gives you
more control over exactly when the processing is done. <p>
