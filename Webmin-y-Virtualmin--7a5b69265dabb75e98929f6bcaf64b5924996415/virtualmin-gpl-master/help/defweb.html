<header>Default website for IP address?</header>

When this field is set to <b>Yes</b>, this virtual server's website will be
served by Apache when it receives a request that doesn't match any other
virtual server on the system. This typically happens if a user uses a URL
with an IP address in it, or a hostname that resolves to your system but does
not match any Virtualmin domain. <p>
