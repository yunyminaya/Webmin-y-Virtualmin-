<header>Scheduled Commands (user's commands)</header>
This option specifies whether the domain owner account can use the Scheduled Commands Webmin module.  A Scheduled Command or at task is a scheduled event that can be used to perform a task once at the time specified.  The Scheduled Commands module provides an easy to use interface to the difficult to remember (and confusing to newbies) syntax of the at command.  Scheduled Commands will be executed as the domain owner user.
