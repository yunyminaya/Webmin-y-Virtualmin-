<header>Apache SSL protocols to allow</header>

By default, when Virtualmin sets up a new SSL website it configures Apache
to reject unsafe SSL protocol versions (TLSv1.1 and below). However, you can
specify your own list of protocols by listing them here. Valid protocols are
<tt>SSLv2</tt>, <tt>SSLv3</tt>, <tt>TLSv1</tt>, <tt>TLSv1.1</tt> and so on.
To reject a protocol, put a <tt>-</tt> before the name. To allow all protocols,
enter <tt>all</tt>. <p>
