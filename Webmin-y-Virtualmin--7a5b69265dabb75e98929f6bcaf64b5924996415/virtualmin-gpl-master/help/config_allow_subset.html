<header>Exclude unverifiable domain names?</header>

By default, when this option is set to "No", an SSL certificate request from an
ACME provider like Let's Encrypt will only succeed if all domain names can be
validated. Changing it to "Yes" allows the request to partially succeed by
excluding domain names from the certificate that cannot be verified.
