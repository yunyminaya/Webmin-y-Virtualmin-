<header>Webmin modules available to virtual server admins</header>

This section allows you to select which Webmin modules virtual server
owners will have access to, for servers created using this template. 
Links to these modules appear on Virtualmin's left menu, typically under
the Services category. You may want to disable some or all of them to
limit the types of more advanced configuration changes server owners
can make, and instead restrict them to the simpler Virtualmin user
interface. <p>

Any changes made here will be applied to all virtual servers using this
template immediately. <p>
