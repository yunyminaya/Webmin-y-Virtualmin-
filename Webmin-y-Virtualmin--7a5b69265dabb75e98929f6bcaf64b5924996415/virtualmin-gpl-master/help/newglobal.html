<header>Global Variables</header>

The variables defined on this page can be used in any domain or user-level template in Virtualmin, such as the email sent to domain owners or mailboxes when
they are created. They are useful for defining system-level constants, such
as the contact email address and name of the master administrator. <p>

To add a variable, just fill in the name and value in the empty row at the
bottom of the table. To remove one, remove the contents of its name field. To
temporarily disable a variable, un-check its box in the enabled column. <p>

Disabled variables will still appear in this list, but will not be used for
substitution when sending email and so on. <p>
