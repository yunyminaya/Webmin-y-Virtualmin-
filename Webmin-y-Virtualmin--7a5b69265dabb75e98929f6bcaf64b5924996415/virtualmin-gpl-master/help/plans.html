<header>Account Plans</header>

Plans are sets of restrictions or limits that can be applied to virtual servers.
Each plan specifies disk quotas, limits on the number of domains, users
and other objects, allowed features and capabilities. A plan can be selected
when creating a virtual server, and can be applied to an existing server at
any time. <p>

Plans limit what the owner of a domain they are applied to can do. They have
no effect on the master administrator, or on resellers (who have their own
separate limits). <p>

Each plan has restrictions of the following types :
<dl>
<dt><b>Disk quotas</b>
<dd>These define the inital quotas for a domain, both overall and for the administration user.<p>

<dt><b>Limits</b>
<dd>These set the number of domains, mailboxes, aliases and aliases that the domain owner can create. The limits apply to all sub-servers too. <p>

<dt><b>Allowed features</b>
<dd>These control which features the domain owner can enable for existing virtual servers or select for new ones, such as a website, DNS domain or email. <p>

<dt><b>Capabilities</b>
<dd>These control what attributes of a virtual server the domain owner can manage, such as mail aliases, databases, scripts and backups. <p>
