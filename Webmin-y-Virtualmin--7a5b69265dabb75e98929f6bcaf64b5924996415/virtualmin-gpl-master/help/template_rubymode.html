<header>Default Ruby execution mode</header>

This option determines if Ruby scripts in new virtual servers are run as the Apache web server user
(typically <tt>httpd</tt> or <tt>apache</tt>), or the Unix user who owns
the virtual server. The former is faster as it means that no additional
processes need to be started to execute Ruby code, but less secure as scripts
read and write files as a user other than the domain owner. <p>
