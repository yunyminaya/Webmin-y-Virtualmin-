<header>Website Redirects</header>

A redirect maps some URL path like /foo to either a different URL, or a 
different directory on the same virtual server. This can be used to provide
more friendly URL paths on your website, or to cope with the movement of
web pages to new locations. <p>

This page lists all existing redirects, and allows you to create a new one
by clicking on the <b>Add a new website redirect</b> link. To edit an existing
redirect, just click on it's source URL path. To remove multiple redirects,
check the boxes next to them and click the <b>Delete</b> button at the bottom
of the page. <p>
