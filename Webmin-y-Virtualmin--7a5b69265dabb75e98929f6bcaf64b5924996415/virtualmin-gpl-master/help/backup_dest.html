<header>Backup destination</header>

These fields control where the Virtualmin backup is written to. You can choose
from one of three destination modes :

<dl>
<dt><b>Local file directory</b>
<dd>In this mode, the backup is simply saved to a file on the system running
Virtualmin. If using the <b>Single archive file</b> backup format, you must
enter a filename here, like <tt>/backup/domainname.tgz</tt>. If using either of
the <b>One file per server</b> formats, you need to enter a directory instead,
like <tt>/backup</tt>.<br>
<dt><b>FTP server</b>
<dd>This mode can be used to have the backup file or files uploaded using the
FTP protocol to another server. You must enter the server name, login, password
and destination file or directory.<br>
<dt><b>SSH server</b>
<dd>This is similar to the FTP mode, but transfers the backup using the SSH
protocol instead.<br>
</dl>

If the backup format is a single file, then the destination you specify here
must be a file, which will be overwritten or created. If creating one file per
domain, then the destination must be a directory which already exists. <p>

If backing up to an SSH or FTP server on a non-standard port, you can enter it
in the server field separated from the hostname with a colon, like 
<tt>backupserver.yourdomain.com:2222</tt> . <p>

If backing up to an SSH server that only supports certificate-based
authentication, the password field is optional. However, the <tt>root</tt>
user on the system must have their SSH public key in the destination user's
<tt>authorized_keys</tt> file. <p>
