<header>Network interface for IPv6 addresses</header>

When Virtualmin adds an IPv6 address for a virtual server, it will be added
to the interface entered here (such as <tt>eth1</tt>). If no interface name
is given, the automatically detected IPv4 interface will be used. This is
typically the first Ethernet interface on the system. <p>
