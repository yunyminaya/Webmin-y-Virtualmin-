<header>Email backup report to</header>

If an email address is entered here, the results of the automatic backup
will be sent to it after the backup is finished. By default it will be
sent on both success or failure, but if you prefer to be only notified
when something goes wrong, you can select the <b>Only send email on failure</b>
option. <p>

To have the same email sent to owners of virtual servers that are backed up,
select the <b>Also send email to owners of backed-up servers</b> checkbox.<p>
