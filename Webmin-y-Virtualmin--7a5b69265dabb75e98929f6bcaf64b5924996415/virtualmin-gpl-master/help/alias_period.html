<header>Minimum time between autoreplies</header>

When automatic reponses are enabled, this option can be used to limit
the rate at which replies are sent to each sender. If a second message
arrives from the same sender in the period entered here, an automatic
response will not be sent. This is useful for preventing mail loops in
which two autoresponders are emailing each other! <p>
