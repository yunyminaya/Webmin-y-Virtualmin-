<header>Setup Let's Encrypt certificate for hostname?</header>

When enabled, Virtualmin will attempt to automatically set up a valid Let's
Encrypt SSL certificate for the hostname during the next configuration
check.
<p>
If successful, this SSL certificate will be used as the default for all
services that do not have their own SSL certificate configured. <p>

If the system's hostname changes, it will be automatically detected and updated.
