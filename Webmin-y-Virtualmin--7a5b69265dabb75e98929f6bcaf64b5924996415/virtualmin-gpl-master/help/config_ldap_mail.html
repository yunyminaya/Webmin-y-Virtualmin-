<header>Add mail attribute to LDAP users?</header>

When storing Virtualmin users in LDAP, this setting allows you to have
their email addresses added to the LDAP database as well. This is useful if
your mail server or spam filter use the same database to deliver email. <p>

The available options are :
<ul>
<li><b>Yes using only <tt>mail</tt> attribute</b><br>
    Each user's primary and extra email addresses will be stored in this
    attribute as separate values.<p>

<li><b>Yes using <tt>mail</tt> and <tt>mailAlternateAddress</tt></b><br>
    Users' primary addresses will be stored in the <tt>mail</tt> attribute,
    and additional addresses in <tt>mailAlternateAddress</tt>.<p>

<li><b>No</b><br>
    Email addresses will never be stored in LDAP.<p>
</ul>

When this is set to <b>Yes</b>, Webmin will add LDAP <tt>mail</tt> attributes
to each user it creates or modifies for their primary and additional email
addresses. This is useful if you are using the same LDAP database with a 
mail server which uses that attribute to figure out where to deliver email.
