<header>Full path to tar command</header>

By default, Virtualmin will use the first command named <tt>tar</tt> that
it finds on the program search path for backups. However, you can specify
an alternate command using this field, such as a GNU TAR which typically
has the command name <tt>gtar</tt>. <p>
