<header>Reset previously configured jail environment</header>

This option allows to reset and remove all commands, libraries, and
files that were previously added to a <em>chroot</em> jail environment.
<p>

All commands, libraries, and associated files that were previously copied
into the jail using tools like <tt>jk_cp</tt> or any other method will be
removed. This effectively resets the jail, returning it to a minimal state.
