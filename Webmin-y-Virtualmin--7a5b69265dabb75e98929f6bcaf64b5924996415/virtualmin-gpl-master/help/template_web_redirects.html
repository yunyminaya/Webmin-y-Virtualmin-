<header>Redirects for new websites</header>

This table allows you to enter website redirects that will be added to all
new virtual servers when they are created. For each redirect you must enter
a source path like <tt>/</tt> or <tt>/phpadmin</tt>, and either a destination
URL or a path relative to the domain's <tt>public_html</tt> directory. <p>

In both fields, virtual server template variables like ${DOM} and ${USER}
can be used. You can also select if the redirect applies when the site is
accessed via HTTP, HTTPS or both. <p>
