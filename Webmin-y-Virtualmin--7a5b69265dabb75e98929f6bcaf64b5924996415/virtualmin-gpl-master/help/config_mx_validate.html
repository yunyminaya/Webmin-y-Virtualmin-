<header>Validate MX records for domains with email?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b> (as it is by default), the MX records
on virtual servers will email enabled will be validated to ensure that they
point to the Virtualmin system. This is normally what you want, unless you
have a spam filter or other forwarder that accepts mail for your domains
before forwarding it to the Virtualmin system. In this case, you should 
select <b>No</b> to prevent false validation errors. <p>
