<header>Only run one spamassasin process at a time?</header>

When this field is set to <b>No</b> as it is by default, Virtualmin will run
multiple concurrent <tt>spamassassin</tt> processes if several email messages
arrive at the same time. However, this may use excessive CPU and RAM on a 
small system. If you select <b>Yes</b>, any virtual servers with
spam filtering enabled will have their Procmail configuration files
updated to run only one copy of <tt>spamassassin</tt> at a time. <p>

This restriction applies across all virtual servers, so even if two messages to
different domains arrive at the same time, there will only ever be one 
<tt>spamassassin</tt> process running. <p>
