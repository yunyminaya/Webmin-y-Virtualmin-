<header>Protected Web Directories (under home directory)</header>
This option specifies whether the domain owner will have access to the Protected Web Directories Webmin module, which allows creation of one or more directories that are password protected.  This can, of course, be done using .htaccess files, but many users do not know how to create or use .htaccess files, and this module provides a web-based means of performing the same task.
