<header>Base number for virtual interfaces</header>

By default Virtualmin will use <tt>eth0:0</tt> for the first virtual IP
interface it creates, then <tt>eth0:1</tt> and so on. However, this field can
be used to change where the interface number after the : starts. This can be
useful if you want to reserve some of the lower numbers for manual assignment,
but in most cases it does not need to be changed. <p>
