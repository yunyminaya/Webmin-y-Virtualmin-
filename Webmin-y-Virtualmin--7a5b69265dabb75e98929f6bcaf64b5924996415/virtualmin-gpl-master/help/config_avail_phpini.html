<header>PHP Configuration (for domain's php.ini files)</header>

When enabled, this option grants virtual server owners access to the 
PHP Configuration module. This will be restricted so that they can only
manage <tt>php.ini</tt> files in their own virtual servers, for which
PHP execution via CGI is enabled. <p>

If a domain using <tt>mod_php</tt> to run PHP scripts, this option also controls
if the virtual server owner is allowed to configure PHP-related settings in
Apache. <p>
