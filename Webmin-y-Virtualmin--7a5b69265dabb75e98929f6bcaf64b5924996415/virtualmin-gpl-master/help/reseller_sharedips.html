<header>Can select from shared IP addresses?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b> and multiple shared IP addresses exist
on the system, the reseller will be able to select one when creating a new
virtual server. Otherwise, the reseller will be limited to the shared IPs
selected in the fields above, or if none are chosen, to the global system
default address.<p>
