<header>Hashed password types to store</header>

By default, Virtualmin will store domain and mailbox passwords in various
hash formats so that the password is available when adding new features to
the domain. However, not all hash formats are equally secure, so this field
can be used to disable storage of some formats. Regardless of what you
select here, the password will always be stored hashed using the system's
default format in <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> or LDAP though. <p>

Be aware that disabling the <b>MySQL</b> hash format may prevent Virtualmin
from creating a MySQL login for mailbox users with the same password that
the mailbox was originally assigned. Disabling the <b>Web digest</b> format
may prevent access to a protected web directory by mailbox users. <p>
