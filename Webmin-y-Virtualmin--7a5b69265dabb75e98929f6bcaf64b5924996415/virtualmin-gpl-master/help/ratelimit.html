<header>Mail Rate Limiting</header>

This page allows you to control the rate at which your system's mail server
will accept new messages. By default any script on the system or remote sender
with an SMTP login can send email with no rate limits, which can be a problem
if a login or script is hijacked by a spammer. This feature lets you set
a reasonable limit, such as 1000 messages per hour across the whole system. <p>

In addition to a global limit, you can also set per-sender domain rates.
These will override any global limit, and can be used to grant a particular
trusted domain a higher or lower limit than what applies to others. <p>
