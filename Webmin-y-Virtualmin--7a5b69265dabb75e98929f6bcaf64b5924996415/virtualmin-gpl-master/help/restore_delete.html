<header>Delete and re-create virtual servers?</header>

By default, if the domain already exists Virtualmin will just restore the
backup over it. This means that any files in the domain's home directory that
were not included in the backup will still exist after the restore. To force
the domain to be deleted before restoring, change this option to <b>Yes</b>.
