<header>Maximum connections for mailbox users</header>

This field controls the number of concurrent connections to MySQL that a
mailbox with database access can make. The default
is to allow an unlimited number of connections, but because each consumes
memory within the MySQL server process you may want to limit total connections
on a busy system. <p>

The limit set here will only be applied when a new mailbox is created,
or when a MySQL login is enabled for an existing mailbox. <p>
