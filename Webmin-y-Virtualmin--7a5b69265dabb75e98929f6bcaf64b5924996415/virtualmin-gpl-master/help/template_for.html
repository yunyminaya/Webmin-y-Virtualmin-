 Templates can apply to any type of domain user account.  The current types are: "Top-level virtual servers", which are standard virtual host accounts; "Sub-servers", which are virtual hosts that belong to a top-level virtual server, and appears within the "domains" directory of the top-level server home directory; "Alias servers" are servers that, generally, simply forward web and mail to an existing top-level domain; and "Server owners" will be available to server owners when they create new domains.  To allow use of this template by domain owners (i.e. Server owners) you must enable at least one other server type).
