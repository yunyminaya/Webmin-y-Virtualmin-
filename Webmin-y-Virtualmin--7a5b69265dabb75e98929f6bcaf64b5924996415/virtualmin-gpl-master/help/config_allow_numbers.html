<header>Allow user and group names starting with numbers?</header>

By default Virtualmin does not allow user, group or database names to start
with a number, as this can confuse some Unix tools. So a domain name like
<tt>1234.com</tt> will have the administration username <tt>one234</tt>
instead of <tt>1234</tt>. However, you can use this option to allow fully
numeric usernames if they work on your system. <p>
