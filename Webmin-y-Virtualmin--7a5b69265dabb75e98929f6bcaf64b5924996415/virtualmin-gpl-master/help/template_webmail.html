<header>Redirect webmail.domain to Usermin?</header>

When this field is set to <b>Yes</b> (as it is by default), any new virtual
servers will have a <tt>webmail</tt> entry added to their DNS domains, with
the same IP address as the server's website. When <tt>http://webmail.thedomain.com/</tt> is accessed, the browser will be redirected to Usermin on the 
same domain, to access web-based email. <p>

If you prefer to use some webmail interface other that Usermin (such as
Squirrelmail or Roundcube) or want to use a different URL for Usermin access,
the redirect URL can be configured in the following <b>URL for webmail redirect</b> field. <p>
