<header>Maximum concurrent backups</header>

To prevent multiple backups from running at the same time and overloading
your system's IO and CPU capacities, Virtualmin can limit the number of backups
that will run at the same time. If this limit is exceeded, additional backups
will either immediately fail, or wait until others have completed. <p>

This can be useful if you allow system owners to schedule their own backups,
and find they have a tendency to all run at the same time. <p>
