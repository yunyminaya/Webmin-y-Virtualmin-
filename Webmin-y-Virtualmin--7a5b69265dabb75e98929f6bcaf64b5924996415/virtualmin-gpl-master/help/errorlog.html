<header>Webserver error log file</header>

This field sets the file to which Apache error logs are written for this
virtual server. Any failures serving content for this domain will be written
to this file. It should only be changed if you are moving logging to a
different directory, such as
<tt>/var/log/virtualmin</tt> or the server's home directory. <p>
