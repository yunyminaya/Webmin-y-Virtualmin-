<header>Command to get a user's quota</header>

When external quota commands are being used, the program set in this
option can be called by Virtualmin to fetch the quota for a single user.
It is called with a single parameter - the full Unix username, and must output
a single line containing the following space-separated fields :

<ol>
<li>Current quota used in 1 kB blocks.
<li>The soft quota in 1 kB blocks, or 0 for unlimited.
<li>The hard quota in 1 kB blocks, or 0 for unlimited.
</ol>

If this command is not set on the Module Config page, Virtualmin will
use the <b>Command to list user quotas</b> instead. <p>
