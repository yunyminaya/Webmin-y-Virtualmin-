<header>Check resolv.conf for this system?</header>

When this is set to <b>Yes</b> (as it is by default), Virtualmin will check
the system's DNS client configuration file <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> to
ensure that it is setup to use the local DNS server for name resolution.
This is necessary, as without it and DNS domains you create may not be
resolvable by the system running Virtualmin until they are fully registered
by a DNS registrar. <p>

If you are certain that this is not needed (perhaps because you have an
automatic secondary DNS server setup), this can be changed to <b>No</b> to
prevent spurious configuration check errors. <p>
