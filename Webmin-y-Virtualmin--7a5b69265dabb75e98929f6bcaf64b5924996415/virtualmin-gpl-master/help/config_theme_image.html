<header>URL for company logo image</header>

When this option is set to the URL to some image, it will be displayed in the 
top-left corner of the Virtualmin user interface, when using the framed theme.
You can set it to the logo for your hosting company, which when clicked on
will open the URL specified by the <b>Link destination for company logo</b>
option. <p>

Although the exact allowed size of the image depends on the browser being
used to access Virtualmin, the image should be at most 220 pixels wide. The
height is not limited, but 120 pixels seems like a reasonable size. <p>
