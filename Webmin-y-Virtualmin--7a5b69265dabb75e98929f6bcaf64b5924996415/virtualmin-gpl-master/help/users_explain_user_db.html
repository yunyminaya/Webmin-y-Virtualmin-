<header>Create Database User</header>

Creates a new database user capable of managing databases only,
leveraging the virtual server owner's quotas for all managed databases.
This user operates solely within the database environment, without creating
a separate Unix account. Additionally, this user can be seamlessly integrated
by merging with a Unix account created using the same username.<p>
