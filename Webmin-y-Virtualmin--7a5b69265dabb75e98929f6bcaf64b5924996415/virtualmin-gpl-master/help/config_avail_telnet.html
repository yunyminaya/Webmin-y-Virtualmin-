<header>SSH/Telnet Login</header>
This option specifies whether the domain owner user can use the SSH/Telnet Login Webmin module.  This module is a Java applet that logs into the server using SSH or Telnet.  It does not work correctly with all browsers, due to Java incompatibilities.  Note that disabling this does not prevent SSH access to the server by the domain owner, merely access to the SSH/Telnet Login module of Webmin.
