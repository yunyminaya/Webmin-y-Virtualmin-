<header>Force group name to be always same as username?</header>

When this is set to <b>Yes</b>, Virtualmin will always make the Unix group name
for new domains the same as the username by default, unless it is already in
user. When <b>No</b> is chosen, the group name is taken from the first part
of the domain name or full domain instead. <p>
