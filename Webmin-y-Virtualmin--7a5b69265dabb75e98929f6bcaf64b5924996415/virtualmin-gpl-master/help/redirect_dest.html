This field determines where the <b>URL path</b> above will be redirected to.
You have two different choices :
<dl>
<dt><b>URL at other website</b>
<dd>When this option is selected, any browser accessing the URL path will be
    redirected to this new URL. If a sub-directory of the path is accessed,
    the redirect will also include that same path. <p>

<dt><b>Directory on this system</b>
<dd>When this option is chosen, any browser accessing the URL path will be
    served content from the specified directory. This should be in the domain's
    home directory, and preferably under <tt>public_html</tt> or else PHP
    scripts are unlikely to work. <p>
</dl>
