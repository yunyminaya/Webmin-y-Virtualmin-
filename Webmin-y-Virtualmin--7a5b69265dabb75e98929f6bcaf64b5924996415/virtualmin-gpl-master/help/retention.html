<header>Mailbox Cleanup</header>

This page can be used to setup a mailbox cleanup policy that applies to some
or all virtual servers on your system. Unlike the per-domain spam and virus
folder cleanup settings, the policy set here applies to all folders of all
users in each chosen domain - including the inbox. <p>

Message deletion can be based either on a time threshold, or a maximum mailbox
size. Deletion based on message age is an easy way to setup a retention policy
to limit the maximum age of stored messages. However, email already downloaded
to users' mail clients (such as Outlook and Thunderbird) will not be removed.
