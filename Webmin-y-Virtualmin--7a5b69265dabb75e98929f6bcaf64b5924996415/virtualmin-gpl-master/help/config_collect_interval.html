<header>Interval between status collection job runs</header>

Virtualmin has a background process called <tt>collectinfo.pl</tt> that
is run by default every 5 minutes from Cron, to collect information used
for the System Information page and historical graphs. If this is too often
for your system, you can increase the gap between runs to up to 30 minutes
using this field. <p>

Alternately, select <b>Never run</b> to turn this process off completely.
If you rarely login to Virtualmin's web interface as <tt>root</tt> and
never look at the graphs of CPU load and other statitics, this option
will reduce the CPU load on your system. However, it will cause the 
System Information page to take longer to load. <p>
