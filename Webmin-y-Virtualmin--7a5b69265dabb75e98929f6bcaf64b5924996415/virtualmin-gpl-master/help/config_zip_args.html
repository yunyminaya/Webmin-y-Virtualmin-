<header>Extra command-line parameters for compression command</header>

By default, Virtualmin runs the <tt>gzip</tt> or <tt>bzip2</tt> commands
for compressing backups with no additional parameters. This means that the
default compression level and format will be used. However, you can use this
field to enter additional parameters, such as <tt>--fast</tt> to make your
backups run faster (at the cost of requiring more space), <tt>--best</tt> to get
better compression (at the cost of CPU time), or <tt>--rsyncable</tt> to make the
file more easily replicatable. <p>
