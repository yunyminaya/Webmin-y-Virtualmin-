<header>Anonymous FTP subdirectory to create</header>
 If anonymous FTP downloads will be allowed, you may specify the subdirectory where files for download will live.  If altering the directives in the previous option, you must include an Anonymous section and it must match the location you provide here.  Note that anonymous access via a specific domain name requires an IP-based virtual FTP host to be configured.
