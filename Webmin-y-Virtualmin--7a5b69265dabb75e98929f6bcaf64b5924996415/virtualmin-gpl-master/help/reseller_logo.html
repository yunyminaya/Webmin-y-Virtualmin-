<header>Reseller's company logo</header>

Virtualmin allows the master administrator to display a logo in the top-left
corner of the theme, which can be customized for their hosting company or ISP.
This field lets you override that logo for the reseller’s customers, who may
have their own company and logo that should appear instead. Alternatively, you
can select "No logo" to display nothing for the reseller’s customers. <p>

Typically, you should enter a full URL like
<tt>http://www.resellerswebsite.com/logo.gif</tt>, but relative URLs for images
that are in other Virtualmin modules are also allowed. <p>

Although the exact allowed size of the image depends on the browser being used
to access Virtualmin, the image should be at most 220 pixels wide. The height is
not limited, but 120 pixels seems like a reasonable size. <p>
