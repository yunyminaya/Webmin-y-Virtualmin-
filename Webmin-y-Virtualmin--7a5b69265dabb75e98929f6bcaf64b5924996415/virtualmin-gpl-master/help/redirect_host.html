<header>Limit redirect to hostname</header>

By default, redirectds will apply regardless of the URL hostname used to
access the website. However, this field can be used instead to limit the
redirect to a specific host. This can be useful for redirecting www.domain.com
to domain.com for example, or changing the redirect for a specific alias domain.
