<header>Hours between Jailkit root directory refreshes</header>

Because each jail contains a copy of files from <tt>/usr</tt>, <tt>/etc</tt>
and other directories, Virtualmin can periodically sync them with the original
files if they have changed. This option controls how many hours must elapse
between each automatic re-sync. <p>
