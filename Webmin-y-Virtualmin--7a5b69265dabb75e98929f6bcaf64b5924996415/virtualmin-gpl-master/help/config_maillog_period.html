<header>Number of days to keep processed mail logs</header>

Virtualmin will periodically scan server mail logs and store the results
in a database file, for quicker searching using the <b>Search Mail Logs</b>
page. This setting can be used to control how long this data is stored for,
in the <tt>/var/webmin/procmail.*</tt> files. The default is 30 days, but you
may want to decrease this if the processed logs are taking up too much disk
space on your system.<p>
