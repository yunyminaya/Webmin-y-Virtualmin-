<header>Maximum message size to process</header>

To prevent huge email messages from being read into <tt>spamassassin</tt> or
sent over a network connection from <tt>spamc</tt> to the <tt>spamd</tt> server,
this option can be used to limit the maximum scanned message size. Large
messages (above 10MB) are rarely spam, so not scanning them is unlikely to
increase the amount of spam that gets through. <p>
