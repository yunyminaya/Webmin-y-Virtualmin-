<header>DNS Records</header>

This page shows DNS records in the selected virtual server's domain, and
allows them to be created, edited and deleted. To change an existing record,
simply click on its name. To add a record, select a type from the menu at
the bottom of the list and click the <b>Create Record</b> button. To remove
records, check the boxes next to their names and click <b>Delete Selected</b>.
<p>

Not all records can be edited or deleted, such as the SOA record or TXT
records automatically created for DKIM signing. Be careful editing existing
records such as <tt>www</tt> or MX records, as this may break access to your
virtual server's website or email delivery. <p>
