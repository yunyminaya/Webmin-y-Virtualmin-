<header>Backup compression format</header>

By default, Virtualmin uses <tt>gzip</tt> compression on its backup files. However, this
option can be used to select the space efficient (but CPU-intensive) <tt>bzip2</tt>
format instead. You can also use un-compressed <tt>tar</tt> format backups, which may be
useful if you want a speedy backup, or if you are writing to tape. Or the 
<tt>zip</tt> format, which is easier to extract on other operating systems. <p>

This option is only used when backing up virtual servers to a directory, with
one file per domain. When backing up to a single file, the filename determines
the compression format (like <tt>domains.tar.gz</tt> or <tt>domains.tar</tt>).
