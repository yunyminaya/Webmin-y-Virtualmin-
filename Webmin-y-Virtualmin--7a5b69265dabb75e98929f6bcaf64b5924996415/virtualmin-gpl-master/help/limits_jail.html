<header>Enable Jailkit for domain</header>

This option allows administrators to restrict a specific domain's user environment
using Jailkit, thereby potentially enhancing security by isolating it from the
complete system.<p>

When enabled, the domain's associated Unix user will be placed in a <em>chrooted</em>
environment using Jailkit. This means the user will only have access to a limited set
of resources, defined by the Jailkit configuration.<p>

Jailkit configuration utilizes the settings from the <tt>jk_init.ini</tt> configuration file
to determine which files, binaries, and libraries are accessible within the <em>chrooted</em>
environment. Additional configurations, such as extra sections or commands, can also be defined
as needed.<p>

Before enabling Jailkit for a domain, ensure you understand the implications. Users might experience
limitations in accessing certain system resources or executing specific commands.<p>
