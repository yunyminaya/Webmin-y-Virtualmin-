<header>Move Virtual Server</header>

Moving a virtual server changes the domain administration who has control
over it. The actual functions of the server are un-effected, but it can now
be managed by a different administrator, and counts towards any limits on
domains, aliases and databases for that new admin. <p>

This page can be used to perform three different types of operations, depending
on what kind of server you are editing and what you want to do with it. They
are :
<dl>
<dt><b>Move a sub-server under a different parent</b>
<dd>When editing a sub-server, you can select a different parent domain from
    the menu to change its ownership. The server's website, DNS domain,
    mailboxes and so on will be un-effected, but it will now be under the
    control of the owner of the new selected parent. Its home directory
    will be moved under the home of the new parent, and all files will have
    their ownership changed to the new parent's user and group. <p>

<dt><b>Move a parent server under a different parent</b>
<dd>When editing a parent server, you can convert it to a sub-server using
    this page. This should be done with care, as some settings that exist
    only for parent servers (such as the password, quotas and limits) will be
    lost, as they are now inherited from the new parent. In addition, any
    Unix user, Unix group or Webmin user associated with the domain will be
    deleted. <p>

<dt><b>Convert a sub-server to a parent server</b>
<dd>When editing a sub-server, you have the option of converting it to a 
    parent server owned by a new server administrator. A username and password
    for the new admin must be entered. After the move is complete, all files
    in the server's new home directory will be owned by the new user.
    Disk quotas, bandwidth limits and server owner limits for the moved server
    will be copied from the old parent, but can subsequently be edited
    separately.<p>

<dt><b>Changing the target of an alias</b>
<dd>If the selected server is an alias of another server, this form can be used
    to point it at a different target. Once the move is complete, web access to
    the domain will return content from the new target, and email to the domain
    will be forwarded to the new target's mailboxes.<p>
