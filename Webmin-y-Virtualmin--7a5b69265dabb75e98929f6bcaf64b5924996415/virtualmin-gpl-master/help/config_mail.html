<header>Mailbox and alias configuration enabled?</header>
This option enables or disables the configuration of mailboxes.  If you do not wish to provide email accounts on your server, for example if you operate a website-only hosting service, you can disable the email features.  If you wish to host email on another server that supports LDAP, you will not disable this feature, you will instead configure Virtualmin to create LDAP users.
