<header>Share SSL certificates between domains where possible?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b> (the default), Virtualmin will share
SSL certificates between virtual servers that have the same ownership, if
the hostnames in the cert match all domains. Selecting <b>No</b> will force
the creation of a separate certificate for each new virtual server. <p>
