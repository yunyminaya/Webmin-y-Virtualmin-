<header>Full path to aws command for S3 operations</header>

If the <tt>aws</tt> command is installed on your system and this field is set
to the full path to it (like <tt>/usr/bin/aws</tt>), Virtualmin will call it
to perform S3 operations for backups such as uploaded and downloading files. 
Because this command was developed by Amazon, it is more reliabile than the 
S3 API built into Virtualmin. <P>
