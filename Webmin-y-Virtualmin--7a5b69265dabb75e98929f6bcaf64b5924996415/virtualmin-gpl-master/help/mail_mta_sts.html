<header>Enable MTA-STS for this domain?</header>

MTA-STS is a protocol for informing other mail servers that
email sent via SMTP to this domain should only be delivered over a secure
transport. When this option is enabled, Virtualmin will create the required
DNS records, webserver config and SSL certificate (if possible) to enable
encrypted incoming email delivery. <p>
