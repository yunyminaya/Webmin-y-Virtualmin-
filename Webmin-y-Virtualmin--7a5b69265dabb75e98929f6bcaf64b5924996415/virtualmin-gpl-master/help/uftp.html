<header>FTP login enabled?</header>

When this option is set to "Yes", the user will be given the shell
<tt><exec %c = &foreign_config($module); $c{'ftp_shell'}></tt>,
allowing them to login via FTP. When set to "No", their shell will be set to
<tt><exec %c = &foreign_config($module); $c{'shell'}></tt>
instead, and FTP logins will be denied. <p>

This assumes that the FTP shell is listed in the <tt>/etc/shells</tt>
file, or otherwise allowed by the FTP server running on your system. <p>
