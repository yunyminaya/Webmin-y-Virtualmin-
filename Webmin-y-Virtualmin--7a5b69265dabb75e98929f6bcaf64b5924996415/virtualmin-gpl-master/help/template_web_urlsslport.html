<header>External port number for SSL virtual hosts</header>

This setting can be used to change the port number Virtualmin uses in URLs
that reference domains created from this template. It can be useful if your
system has a proxy or cache in front of it listening on port 443, and
Virtualmin has been configured to create Apache virtual hosts on a different
port. <p>
