<header>BIND DNS Server (for DNS domain)</header>
Enable this if the domain owner account should have the ability to edit DNS
records for their domain. Depending on the configuration, the domain owner may
create new subdomain records, modify existing domain records, adjust MX records,
and more. Inexperienced users might not need or want this level of flexibility.
