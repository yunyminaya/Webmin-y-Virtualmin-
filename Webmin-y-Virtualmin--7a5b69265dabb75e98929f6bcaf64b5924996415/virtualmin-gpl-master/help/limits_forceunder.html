<header>Allow sub-servers not under this domain?</header>

If <b>No</b> is selected for this option, all sub-servers created by this 
server owner will be forced to have domain numbers under the domain of the 
parent server. For example, if the parent domain was <tt>foo.com</tt>, then
<tt>bar.foo.com</tt> would be an allowed domain name, but <tt>bar.com</tt>
would not be. <p>
