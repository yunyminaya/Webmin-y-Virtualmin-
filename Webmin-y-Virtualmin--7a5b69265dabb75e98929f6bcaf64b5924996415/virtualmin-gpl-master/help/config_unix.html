<header>Administration user creation enabled?</header>

This option determines if the creation of a Unix user for a new
top-level virtual server is always done (and the option hidden), or if it is optional
when creating a server. It is generally a good idea to set this option to
<b>Always</b>, as a Unix user is needed unless creating a DNS-only 
or web-proxy-only domain. <p>
