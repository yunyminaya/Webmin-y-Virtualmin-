<header>BIND setup and configuration enabled?</header>
This enables or disables the configuration of the local name server.  If you already have domain management configured elsewhere, or will not be creating many new domains (if, for example, you are using Virtualmin primarily for email account generation within one or a small set of domains), you may choose to disable this.  Note that even if you wish to host primary and secondary DNS on separate machines, you will still want this option enabled, so that the Cluster DNS Slaves feature can be used to propogate the new zones out to your master servers automatically.
