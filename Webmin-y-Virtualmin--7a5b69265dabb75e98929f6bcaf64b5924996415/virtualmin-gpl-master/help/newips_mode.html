<header>Address type to change</header>

This field determines if the IP address change will apply to the virtual
servers' real IP address (used in the Apache configuration and in any
virtual interfaces), or to the IP address used in DNS records. These can
differ for systems that are behind a NAT gateway or proxy. <p>
