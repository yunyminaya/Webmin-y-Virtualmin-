<header>Virtualmin settings to also backup</header>

These checkboxes can be used to include global Virtualmin settings in a backup,
along with details of the selected domains. This allows you to backup your
entire Virtualmin install from a single place, rather than needing to backup
the <tt>/etc/webmin/virtual-server</tt> directory separately. <p>
