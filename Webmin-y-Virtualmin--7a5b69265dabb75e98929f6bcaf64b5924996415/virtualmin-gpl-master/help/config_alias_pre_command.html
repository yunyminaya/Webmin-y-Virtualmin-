<header>Command to run before making changes to an alias</header>

This option can be used to specify a script or command to be run before
a mail alias is created, modified or deleted. It can make use of the
environment variables ALIAS_FROM, ALIAS_TO and ALIAS_ACTION to determine
what alias is being changed and what is happening to it. If the command
exits with a non-zero status, modification of the alias will be vetoed. <p>
