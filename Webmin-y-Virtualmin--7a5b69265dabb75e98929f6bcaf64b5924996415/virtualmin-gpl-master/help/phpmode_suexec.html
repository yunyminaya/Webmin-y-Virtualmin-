<header>Run CGI scripts as domain owner?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, all regular CGI scripts in this
virtual server will be run with the permissions of the server's owner.
For security purposes, this should almost always be enabled, unless your
server is only used by a single person. <p>
