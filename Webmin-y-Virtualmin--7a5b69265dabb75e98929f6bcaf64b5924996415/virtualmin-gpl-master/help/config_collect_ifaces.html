<header>Network interfaces for traffic graph</header>

By default, Virtualmin includes the sum of network traffic on all Ethernet,
wireless and PPP interfaces in the graphs on the <b>System Statistics</b> page.
However, you can instead limit the collection to specific interfaces entered
here. This can be useful if your system has both internal and Internet
interfaces, and you only care about Internet traffic. <p>

Interfaces must be entered as Linux device names, like <tt>eth1</tt>. <p>
