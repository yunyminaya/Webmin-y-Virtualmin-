<header>DMARC policy for emails that fail SPF or DKIM</header>

If a message fails SPF or DKIM validation, this setting determines how the
receiving mail server should handle it. The options are :

<ul>
<li><b>Take no action</b> - The message is still delivered as normal.
<li><b>Quarantine email</b> - This is recipient-dependent, but typically means that the message will be placed into a spam folder.
<li><b>Reject email</b> - The message will be deleted.
</ul>
