<header>Custom Shells</header>

This page allows you to customize the Unix shells available to mailbox users and
virtual server administrators. The shell is used by servers like ProFTPd and
SSHd to control the types of logins allowed for each user, such as email,
FTP and remote shell access. <p>

When <b>Virtualmin built-in defaults</b> is selected, the shells available
are determined automatically by Virtualmin, which is typically satisfactory
for most systems. If you want to modify them, select <b>Custom shells below</b>
and make changes to the table. <p>

For each shell, the following fields can be edited :
<dl>
<dt><b>Enabled?</b>
<dd>This checkbox determines if the shell is visible when creating or editing
    users.

<dt><b>Path to shell</b>
<dd>This must contain the full path to the shell command, like <tt>/bin/sh</tt> or <tt>/bin/false</tt>.

<dt><b>Description</b>
<dd>This is the title that will appear in the menu when the shell is selected.

<dt><b>Admin?</b>
<dd>Check this box if you want the shell to be made available for virtual server administrator Unix users.

<dt><b>Mailbox?</b>
<dd>Check this box if you want the shell to be made available for mail / FTP users.

<dt><b>Default?</b>
<dd>Exactly one shell for administrators and one for mailboxes must have this entry checked, indicating that it is the default for Unix users of that type.

<dt><b>Access</b>
<dd>This menu indicates to Virtualmin what type of access is granted by this shell. When adding your own, you should select if it allows FTP and/or SSH or not.
