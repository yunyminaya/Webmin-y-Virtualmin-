<header>Time to wait if maximum is exceeded</header>

If this is set to <b>Halt immediately</b> and a backup is started that would
exceed the limit, it will fail at once. Alternately, you can enter a number
of seconds to wait for other backups to complete before continuing. If that
timeout is exceeded and too many backups are still running, the new one
will fail. <p>
