Enable this if the domain owner should have the ability to edit the Apache
configuration for their domain. While this level of control can be overwhelming
for inexperienced users, it provides great flexibility for experienced ones.
It’s also possible, with modifications to the default access control
configuration, to allow direct access to the virtual domains section of Apache’s
configuration file. Although protections are in place to prevent malicious
actions, they may not be perfect. By default, the granted privileges are
generally safe for use in a shared hosting environment.
