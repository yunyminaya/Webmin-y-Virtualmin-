<header>SpamAssassin client program</header>

This option determines if spam filtering is done using the standalone
<tt>spamassassin</tt> program, or the <tt>spamc</tt> lightweight client.
In the latter case, your system must be running the <tt>spamd</tt> server,
or no spam classification will be done. <p>

Using <tt>spamc</tt> is typically faster and consumes less memory and CPU.
However, it will take away the ability to have a different SpamAssassin
configuration for each virtual server, as the <tt>spamd</tt> server can only
read a single set of configuration files. <p>
