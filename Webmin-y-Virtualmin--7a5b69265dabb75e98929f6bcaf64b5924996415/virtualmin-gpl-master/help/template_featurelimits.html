<header>Default available features</header>

When this option is set the <b>Automatic</b> (as it is by default), new
top-level virtual servers will have their allowed features set based
on those initially enabled when the server is created. If you want to 
give the server owner access to additional features by default, select the
<b>Selected below</b> radio button and check the boxes for the features
you want to grant. <p>
