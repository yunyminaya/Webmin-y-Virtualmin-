<header>Automatically delete spam?</header>

This option can be used to have spam in mail users' spam folders in virtual
servers created with this template automatically
deleted once it becomes too old or exceeds a certain size. Only spam that 
exceeds whatever size or age criteria you set here will be removed, and checking
is done once per day around midnight. <p>

Enabling this is generally a good idea, as it keeps down disk usage and
prevents users from having all their quotas filled up with old spam. <p>
