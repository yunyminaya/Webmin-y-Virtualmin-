<header>IPv4 address for name-based servers</header>

This option can be used to have virtual servers created for this reseller
use an IPv6 address other than the system's default, which is typically shared
by all name-based virtual websites. This can be useful for 'branding'
servers created by different resellers, by have each reseller's IPv4 address
resolve to a different hostname. <p>

The IP you enter must already be active on the system, which can be done
in Webmin's Network Configuration module. The IP will not be used for
virtual servers with their own private IPs, as each always gets a distinct
address. <p>
