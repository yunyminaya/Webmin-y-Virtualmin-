<header>Batch Create Servers</header>

This page allows you to create multiple virtual servers at once from
a text file. This file must list one server per line, and each line must
have the following format :<p>

<tt><i>domain</i>:<i>description</i>:<i>password</i>:[<i>username</i>]:[<i>parent-domain</i>]:[<i>ip-address</i>]:[<i>alias-domain</i>]</tt><p>

The meanings of the fields are :<br>
<dl>
<dt>domain
<dd>The domain name for the virtual server to create, such as <i>foo.com</i>.
<dt>description
<dd>A human-readable description, such as <i>Joe's Website</i>.
<dt>password
<dd>The password for the server's administration login. This is only needed for parent servers.
<dt>username
<dd>The administration username for the server. If this is left blank, a username is selected automatically.
<dt>parent-domain
<dd>The domain name of the parent server to create this server under. If this is left empty, the new server is created as a parent itself.
<dt>ip-address
<dd>For virtual servers that do not need their own private IP, this field can be left blank. Otherwise, you must either enter a valid un-used address, or the word <tt>allocate</tt> to have Virtualmin select one for you (if configured).
<dt>alias-domain
<dd>The domain name of the virtual server that this should become an alias for. If left out, the new server will be either top-level or a sub-server.
</dl><p>

Quotas, bandwidth, and other limits for the created servers are set based on
the template you select on this form. The features for the created servers
are determined by the feature checkboxes, just as on the normal single-server
creation page. <p>

If your system uses reseller accounts, you can select to have all the virtual
servers created under the ownership of a reseller. This option is only available
to the master administrator. <p>
