<header>Restart services that are detected as down?</header>

The background process <tt>collectinfo.pl</tt> checks the status of
services important to Virtualmin, such as Apache, BIND and Postfix. If this
option is set to <b>Yes</b>, it will attempt to re-start any services
that it detects as down. This can be useful if you have services that are
prone to random failure. <p>
