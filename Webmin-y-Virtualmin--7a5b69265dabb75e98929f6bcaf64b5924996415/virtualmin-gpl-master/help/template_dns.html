<header>BIND DNS records for new domains</header>

When creating a new domain, a new zone is created.  You may customize the records that are created here.  This field expects valid named.conf entries, though the Virtualmin variables will be translated to the appropriate values for the domain.  You may either add records to the standard Virtualmin-generated records, or you may completely replace the Virtualmin records with your own.  For further information on BIND, consult the BIND chapter in the Webmin books.<p>

<include subs>

If you want to create your own SOA record, the substitutions <tt><b>${CURRENT_YEAR}</b></tt>, <tt><b>${CURRENT_MONTH}</b></tt> and <tt><b>${CURRENT_DAY}</b></tt> may also be useful. <p>
