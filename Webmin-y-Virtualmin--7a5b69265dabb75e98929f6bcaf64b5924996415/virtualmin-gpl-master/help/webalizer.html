<header>Set up Webalizer for web logs?</header>

When this option is enabled, Webalizer will be set up to generate a report on
the websites log files every 24 hours. The report will be placed in 
<tt>~/public_html/stats</tt>, and the domains web logs will be truncated
each time the report is updated to save disk space. <p>
