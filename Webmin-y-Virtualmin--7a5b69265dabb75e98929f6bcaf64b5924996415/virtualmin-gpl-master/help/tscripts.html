<header>Template Webapp Installers</header>

This page allows you to specify third-party web apps to be installed when a 
new virtual server is created using this template. For each webapp, the
following information must be entered :<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Webapp</b>
<dd>The name and version of a webapp to install
<dt><b>URL path</b>
<dd>A path under the virtual server's website to install the webapp, such as <tt>/wordpress</tt>. This will also determine the directory under <tt>~/public_html</tt> that contains the webapp's files.
<dt><b>DB name</b>
<dd>The name of the database that the webapp will use to store data. The options are :
	<dl>
	<dt><b>None</b>
	<dd>This should be selected for web apps that do not need a database, such as <b>Gallery</b>.
	<dt><b>Main database</b>
	<dd>The webapp's database will be the virtual server's primary database of the chosen type.
	<dt><b>Other</b>
	<dd>If you want this webapp to use its own private database, this option can be selected and the pattern for a database entered in the adjacent text field. For example, you might enter <i>${DB}_phpnuke</i>. If the resulting database does not exist, it will be created as part of the webapp installation process.
