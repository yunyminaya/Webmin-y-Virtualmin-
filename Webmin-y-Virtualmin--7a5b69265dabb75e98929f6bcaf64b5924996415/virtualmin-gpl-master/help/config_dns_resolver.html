<header>Detect system external IP address using DNS</header>

This option uses the <tt>dig</tt> command to query a DNS server and detect the
system's external IP address. For instance, you can set this field to
<tt>myip.opendns.com resolver1.opendns.com</tt> (a space-separated query name
and nameserver). This avoids relying on HTTP-based method and retrieves the IP
address directly from the DNS server.<p>

However, DNS method should be used with care if the system is behind a NAT,
proxy, or VPN, as the detected IP may not reflect the actual public IP of the
machine. It may instead show the external IP of the NAT gateway, proxy, or VPN
endpoint.<p>
