<header>Default PHP execution mode</header>

The default PHP script execution mode defines how PHP code will be processed
in new virtual servers.<p>

<b>Disabled</b> mode means that PHP scripts are not executed by the server but
are instead treated as plain text files. This mode can be used when PHP processing
is not required or when serving PHP code as downloadable files.<p>

<b>FPM</b> is the preferred mode, offering high efficiency and advanced features
like adaptive process management. It operates as a standalone FastCGI server,
ideal for high-traffic sites due to its robust performance capabilities.<p>

<b>FCGI</b> is useful for servers where FPM is not available. It also supports
per-virtual-host configurations, though it generally doesn't match FPM in terms
of scalability and management features.<p>

<b>CGI</b> mode runs each PHP script as a separate process through the
CGI protocol. This mode is less efficient than FPM or FCGI due to the overhead
of creating a new process for each request. It's rarely used in modern setups
due to its performance limitations.<p>

<b>mod_php</b> integrates PHP directly into the Apache
web server, allowing PHP scripts to execute within the server's own process.
However, due to security and isolation issues, plus the discontinuation of
support and updates, it is now obsolete.
