Virtualmin can also manage local users on your server, which can be useful if you'd like to use Virtualmin just to manage mail and home websites.  With a little re-configuration, Virtualmin can provide an easy to use interface for adding mailbox/website users whose website can be reached via "http://www.domain.com/~username".  This is not the primary focus of Virtualmin, but it can make mailbox and website maintenance for ISPs easier.
