<header>Include backup transfers in usage?</header>

By default, Virtualmin will include bandwidth consumed by FTP, SSH and S3
backups for a virtual server in it's total usage. By changing this option
to <b>No</b> you can prevent backup traffic from being included. This may make
sense if all backups are to a storage server on your local network. <p>
