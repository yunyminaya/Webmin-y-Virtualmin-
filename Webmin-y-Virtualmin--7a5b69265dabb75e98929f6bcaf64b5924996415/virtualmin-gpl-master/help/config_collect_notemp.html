<header>Collect drive and CPU temperatures?</header>

When this is set to <b>Yes</b> (as it is by default), Virtualmin will on
Linux systems collect average drive and CPU temperatures for display on
the <b>System Statistics</b> page. These require that the <tt>smartctl</tt>
and <tt>sensors</tt> commands be installed and working properly. <p>

If you don't care about system temperatures or want to speed up the backup
status collection job, you can change this to <b>No</b>. <p>
