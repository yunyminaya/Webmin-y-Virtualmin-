<header>Login permissions</header>

This menu determines what kind of login access the user is granted. Typically
you will have a choice of email only or email and FTP, but the options can be
customized by the master administrator. <p>

The selected access level determines the shell for the underlying Unix user,
which is then used by the FTP and SSH servers to control whether they can log in
or not. <p>
