<header>Include alias domains in limits?</header>
Alias domains are domains that point to an existing domain for some or all services.  If you wish to consider alias domains as part of the domain they alias for quota purposes, select yes here.  If the account limits will be specified separately, select no.  Alias domains are normally quite small, as they merely direct all traffic to the domain they are aliases of, but with appropriate privileges a domain owner could use the alias domain account for other purposes.
