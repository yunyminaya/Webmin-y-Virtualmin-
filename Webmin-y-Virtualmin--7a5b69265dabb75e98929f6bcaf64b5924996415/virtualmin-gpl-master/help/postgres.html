<header>Create PostgreSQL login?</header>

If selected, a PostgreSQL account will be created for this domain, typically with
the same name as the domain's administrative login. If you are using the default
template settings, a PostgreSQL database will be created for the virtual server
as well. The database name will be the first part of the domain name - so if
you are creating the domain <tt>foo.com</tt>, the database would be called
<tt>foo</tt>. <p>
