<header>Mail alias mode for alias domains</header>

This setting controls how Virtualmin forwards email from an alias virtual
server to the target server. The default setting is <b>Catchall forwarding</b>,
which uses a single catchall alias in the source domain to forward all messages
to corresponding addresses in the target. The alternative is <b>Copy aliases
from target</b>, which tells Virtualmin to duplicate all mail aliases in the 
target real domain into the alias. <p>

The advantage of this second mode is that with the Postfix mail server, email
to an address in the alias domain will be rejected at the SMTP level. When
the catchall mode is selected, email to an invalid address will be forwarded
to the target domain and then bounced back to the sender. This can generate
significant load on your system and cause email to be sent to incorrect
addresses if a spammer is sending email to a large number of addresses within
the alias domain. <p>

As with most template settings, this only applies to virtual servers created
after the setting was changed. <p>
