<header>Transfer Virtual Server</header>

This page can be used to send a virtual server (and any sub-servers or aliases)
to another system running Virtualmin. The transfer process using Virtualmin's
backup and restore functionality, and will include all home directory content,
databases, DNS records and other configurations. <p>

The hostname or IP address of the target system must be entered in the
<b>Hostname of destination system</b> field, and the <b>Root password for destination system</b> field should be filled in unless you have password-less
SSH authentication setup. <p>

By default the domain will be simply copied to the new system. However, the
<b>Action after transfer</b> field can be used to have it moved instead, by
deleting the server from the source system. This is necessary if both the 
source and destination share a clustered DNS server, or are secondary name
servers for each other. <p>
