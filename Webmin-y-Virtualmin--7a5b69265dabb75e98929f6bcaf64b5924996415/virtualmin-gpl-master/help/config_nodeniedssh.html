<header>Add users with no SSH access to deniedssh group?</header>

By default, Virtualmin will configure the SSH server to prevent logins by
users whose shells would not allow SSH access anyway. This is done by populating
the <tt>deniedssh</tt> group, and adding it to the OpenSSH configuration.<p>

If you would like to disable this behavious, perhaps because it is not necessary
or causes domain creation to take too long, change this field to <b>No</b>.<p>
