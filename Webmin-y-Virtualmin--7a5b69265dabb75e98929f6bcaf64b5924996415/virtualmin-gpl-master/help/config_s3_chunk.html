<header>S3 upload chunk size</header>

S3 backups larger than 2GB in size are uploaded by Virtualmin in file chunks
whose size is specified by this option. Because there is a limit of 10000 chunks
per file, the default size of 5MB will not be big enough for backups of larger
than approximately 48GB. <p>
