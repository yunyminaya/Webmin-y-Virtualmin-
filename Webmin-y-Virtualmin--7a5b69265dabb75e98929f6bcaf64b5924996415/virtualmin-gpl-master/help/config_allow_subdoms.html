<header>Allow creation of sub-domains?</header>

When this option is set to <b>No</b> (as it is by default), Virtualmin will
not allow the creation of sub-domains, which are a special type of sub-server
that is under the same domain as its parent. Only when <b>Yes</b> is selected
will sub-domains be allowed - but this is discouraged, as they are confusing
to users and provide little benefit over sub-servers. <p>
