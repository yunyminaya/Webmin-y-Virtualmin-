<header>Additional locations for PHP commands</header>

Virtualmin will automatically detect major PHP versions installed on your
system, as long as they are in directories in the search path. However, this
field can be used to enter the paths to additional PHP executables, which
can be useful if you want to run a version that is higher than the one that
comes installed by default. <p>
