<header>Virtualmin URL for use in email messages</header>

When Virtualmin sends email messages to the system administrator, it will
often include the URL for Virtualmin on the system that message was sent from.
By default this is based on the system's hostname, but you can set a custom
URL like <tt>https://yourdomain.com:10000</tt> using this field. <p>
