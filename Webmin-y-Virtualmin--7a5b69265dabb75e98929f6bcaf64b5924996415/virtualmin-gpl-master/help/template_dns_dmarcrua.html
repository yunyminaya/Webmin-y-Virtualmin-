<header>Reporting URI for aggregate reports</header>

By default, the DMARC DNS record for new domains will use
<tt>mailto:postmaster@domain.com</tt> as the address for receivers of spam to
report aggregate summaries. However, you can enter a new URI here to 
customize the email address, for example to use a common address across all
domains. <p>
