<header>Contact email address is mandatory?</header>

When this is set to <b>No</b>, when creating a virtual server the contact email
address is optional. In this situation Virtualmin will send email to the domain
owner's mailbox, which might not be checked regularly. Selecting <b>Yes</b> here
will force a separate address to be entered when creating a domain. <p>
