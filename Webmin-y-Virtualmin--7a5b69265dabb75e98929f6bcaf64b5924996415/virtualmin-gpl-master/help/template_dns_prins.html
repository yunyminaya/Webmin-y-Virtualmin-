<header>Add NS record for this system?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b> as it is by default, an NS record
will be added to new DNS zones for the <b>Primary DNS server hostname</b>
set above. A corresponding A record will also be created with the correct
IP address for this nameserver. <p>

It should only ever be set to <b>No</b> if you are using a hidden
primary nameserver. If you are using a cloud DNS provider, this option
has no effect. <p>
