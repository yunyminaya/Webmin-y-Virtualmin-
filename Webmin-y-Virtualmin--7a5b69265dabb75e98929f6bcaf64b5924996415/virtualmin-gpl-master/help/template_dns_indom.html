<header>Create NS records in server's domain?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b>, the <tt>NS</tt> records added to the new DNS
domain will point to addresses within the domain itself, named like
<tt>ns1</tt>, <tt>ns2</tt> and so on. Corresponding <tt>A</tt> records will be
created with the correct IP addresses for the configured nameservers. <p>
