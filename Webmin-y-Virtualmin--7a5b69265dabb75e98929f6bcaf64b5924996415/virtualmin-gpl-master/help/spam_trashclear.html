<header>Automatically delete trash?</header>

This option can be used to have spam in mail users' trash folders automatically
deleted once it becomes too old or exceeds a certain size. Only mail that 
exceeds whatever size or age criteria you set here will be removed, and checking
is done once per day around midnight. <p>
