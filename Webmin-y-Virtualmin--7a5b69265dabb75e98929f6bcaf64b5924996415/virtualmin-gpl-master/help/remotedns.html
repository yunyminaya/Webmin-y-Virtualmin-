<header>Remote DNS Servers</header>

This page lets you register systems running Webmin as DNS servers, allowing
zones to be hosted on them instead of your primary Virtualmin system. The
systems you add must already have BIND running and the Webmin DNS Server module
properly configured. <p>

Once added, DNS zones can be moved to or created on the remote systems. It is
also possible to use only remote DNS, and shut down the BIND server on this
system to save memory. <p>
