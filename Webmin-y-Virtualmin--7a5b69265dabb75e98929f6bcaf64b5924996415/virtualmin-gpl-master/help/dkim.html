<header>DomainKeys Identified Mail</header>

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is a protocol for signing outgoing email
messages with a signature that proves it really comes from the sender's
domain. This can be used by recipient mail servers or spam filters to detect
sender forgery, which is typically done by spammers to avoid having their
domain blacklisted. <p>

When DKIM is enabled using Virtualmin your mail server will be configured
to add a DKIM signature to all outgoing messages, and a public key will be
added to each of the DNS domains on your system. Other mail servers can then
use this key to verify the signature on relayed messages, thus ensuring that
the sender's address was not forged. <p>

If you have virtual servers for which DNS is hosted elsewhere but mail is
hosted by this system, you can enter their domain names into the <b>Additional
domains to sign for</b> box. The records in the <b>DNS records for additional
domains</b> box can then be manually added to those zones. <p>
