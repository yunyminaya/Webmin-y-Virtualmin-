<header>Re-enable servers that fall below limit</header>
If a server has been disabled for exceeding the bandwidth limit, this option
allows it to be automatically re-enabled if it falls below the limit again.
This can happen at the start of a new bandwidth accounting period, or if
its limit is increased. <p>
