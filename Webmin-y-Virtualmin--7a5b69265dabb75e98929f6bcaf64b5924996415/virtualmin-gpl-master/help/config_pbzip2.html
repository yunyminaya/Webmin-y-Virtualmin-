<header>Bzip2 compression command</header>

If your system has the multi-threaded bzip2 compression command <tt>pbzip2</tt>
installed, this option can be used to have Virtualmin use it. On a multi-CPU or
multi-core system it runs faster than regular <tt>bzip2</tt> (and nearly as fast
as gzip), but uses more CPU overall.
