new virtual servers. The possible options are:

<ul>
<li><b>CGI scripts disabled</b> - scripts cannot be run at all.

<li><b>FCGIwrap server</b> - scripts are run via a background server, one per domain.

<li><b>suEXEC</b> - scripts are launched via the Apache <tt>suexec</tt> wrapper. Note
that this option might not be accessible on all systems.
</ul>
