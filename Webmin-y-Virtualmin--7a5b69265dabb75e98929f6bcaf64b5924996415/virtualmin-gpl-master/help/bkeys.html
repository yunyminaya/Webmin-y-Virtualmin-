<header>Backup Encryption Keys</header>

This page allows you to create and manage GPG keys that Virtualmin can use
to backup virtual servers and global settings. Encryption protects the
contents of your backups when they are stored on an untrusted remote system
(such as S3), and detects unauthorized modifications. <p>

A key can either by generated by Virtualmin, or imported from an existing
ASCII format GPG private key file. To begin the process of creating a key,
click the <b>Add a new encryption key</b> link. Once a key has been defined,
you can edit it by clicking on the description in the list of keys, or remove
it by checking the box next to the key and hitting the <b>Delete Selected
Keys</b> button. <p>
