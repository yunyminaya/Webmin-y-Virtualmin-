<header>Number of DNSSEC keys</header>

Recommended DNSSEC practice is for every zone to have two keys - one for
signing the records (the zone key), and the other for signing just the
zone key. However, you can use this option to change the default number
of keys for new zones to just one, if that makes more sense for your
system. This avoids the overhead of having to periodically re-generate and
re-sign the zone key. <p>
