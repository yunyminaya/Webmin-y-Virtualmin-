<header>Separately editable DNS records for alias domains?</header>

By default, alias domains have their DNS records copied from the target domain,
meaning they cannot be edited separately. Setting this option to "Yes" allows
newly created alias domains to have their own independent set of records.
However, this is unlikely to be useful for most users. <p>
