<header>Can choose database names?</header>

If this restriction is set to <b>No</b>, the server owner will not be allowed
to select the default database name when creating a sub-server that has a 
database feature enabled. Instead, it will always default to the first part
of the domain name. <p>

In addition, the user will not be able to remove the default database
for any existing domain, as this would allow them to effectively rename
the default database after the domain is created. <p>
