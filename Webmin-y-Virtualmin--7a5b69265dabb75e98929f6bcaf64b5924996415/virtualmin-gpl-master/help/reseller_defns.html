<header>Nameserver hostnames</header>

By default, virtual servers created by this reseller will have the same
nameservers in their BIND configuration as every other domain. However, because
resellers often want to make it appear as though they are running their own
server, they may not want your nameserver hosts to appear in the domains
they create. <p>

This field allows you to enter custom nameserver hosts that will be used as
the <tt>NS</tt> records in any domain the reseller creates. Make sure that
they already exist in DNS, and are being used by whatever registrar the
domains are registered with. <p>
