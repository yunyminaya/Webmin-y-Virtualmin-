<header>Can select home directories for users?</header>
If enabled, the domain owner can choose to give users a different home directory than the default.  It may be useful if domain owners can install additional services, like an application server (i.e. Zope, Webrick, etc.), and they'd like to be able to use a different user for the app server.  Generally, only users that have a relatively high level of trustworthiness will need this kind of flexibility.
