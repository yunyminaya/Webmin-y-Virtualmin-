<header>Allow editing of PHP configuration?</header>

When this option is set to <b>Yes</b> (as it is by default), virtual server
owners are allowed to edit their PHP configuration. However, you can set it
to <b>No</b> to prevent this, either for security reasons or to prevent
in-experienced admins from making incorrect changes. <p>

This is implemented by making the domain's <tt>~/etc/php.ini</tt> file
editable only by the <tt>root</tt> Unix user. Be aware that this is not
a foolproof method of preventing changes to the PHP configuration though - the
domain owner could still specify a different config file by editing the PHP
wrapper scripts in <tt>cgi-bin</tt>, running their own copy of PHP, or
running PHP scripts as CGI programs. <p>
