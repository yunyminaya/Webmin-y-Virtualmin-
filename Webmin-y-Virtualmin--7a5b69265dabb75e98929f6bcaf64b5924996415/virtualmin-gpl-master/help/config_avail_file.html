<header>File Manager (home directory only)</header>
The File Manager is an advanced Java applet that offers a dual-pane view of the
server’s file system. It’s one of the most powerful features of Webmin, allowing
even inexperienced users to manage files, directories, and permissions, edit
text files, upload and download files, and more. By default, the domain owner
will only be able to access their own directory and its subdirectories.
