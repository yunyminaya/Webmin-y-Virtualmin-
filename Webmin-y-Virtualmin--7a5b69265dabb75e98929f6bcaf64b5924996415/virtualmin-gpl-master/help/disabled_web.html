<header>Disabled website HTML</header>

This field can be used to customize the message that appears when connecting
to a website for a disabled Virtual server. The default message simply states
<b>Website Disabled</b>. You can use typical substitutions like ${DOM} and
${USER} to get details of the domain being disabled, ${DISABLED_WHY} to
get the reason the domain was disabled, and ${DISABLED_TIME} to get the time
at which the disable was done. <p>
