<header>Additional named.conf directives for new zones</header>

When a new BIND DNS zone is created, the directives entered into this text
box will be added to the zone's section in the <tt>named.conf</tt>
configuration file. For example, you could enter the following to limit zone
transfers to a selected IP addresses :

<pre>
allow-transfer { 
  1.2.3.4;
  1.2.3.10;
};
</pre>

This feature should only be used by those already familiar with the BIND
configuration format, as a mistake could cause your entire DNS server to
stop working. <p>
