<header>Create Unix user for new resellers?</header>

This option controls whether newly create reseller accounts get an associated
Unix user (for SSH and FTP access) by default, or not. However, it can be
over-ridden on the reseller creation form or when calling the <tt>create-reseller</tt> API command. <p>
