<header>Always show output from pre and post commands?</header>

When this is set to <b>Yes</b>, the output from any pre or post domain-creation
commands will be always displayed, even if they do not fail. When set to 
<b>No</b> the output will only be shown if the command fails with a non-zero
exit status. <p>
