<header>Allowed MySQL client hosts</header>
 If additional hosts should be allowed to query the MySQL database, you may specify them here.  This could be useful if this system is used as a database server and other machines will use the database.  Security precautions should be followed to insure illicit access is not unintentionally allowed.
