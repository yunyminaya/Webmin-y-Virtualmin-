<header>Can be restored by virtual server owners?</header>

If enabled, backups created on this schedule can be restored by the owners
of their virtual servers via the Backup Logs page, in addition to backups they
created themselves. This allows the master admin to ensure that everything
is backed up, but gives server owners the flexibility to perform their own
restores. <p>
