<header>Create Webserver User</header>

Creates a new webserver user within the <tt>htpasswd</tt> files, specifically
for secure authentication to protected web directories. This user is distinct
from Unix accounts, dedicated exclusively to managing access to web directories.
Additionally, this user can be seamlessly integrated by merging with a Unix
account created using the same username.<p>
