<header>Can create and edit plans?</header>

This field determines whether the reseller is allowed to create their own plans
or edit those they have already created. If not, only plans created by root can
be used.<p>

Even if a reseller can create plans, the total disk space and other resources
allocated to virtual servers cannot exceed the limits set by the master
administrator. <p>
